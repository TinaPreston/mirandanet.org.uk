that my teaching philosophy would change forever?</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">My interest in computers goes back to the day when my teenage son told me about an &lsquo;electric typewriter&rsquo; that was connected to a screen.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This, he said, would allow me to edit my work without using Tippex!</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">I can remember declining his offer and admitting that these &lsquo;new fangled ideas&rsquo; were just too complicated and that the status quo suited me just fine.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">At this stage, I must tell you that I&rsquo;d learnt to type on an old, manual typewriter the likes of which I have recently seen in a museum.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Nevertheless, being a bright, innovative adolescent, his nagging got the better of us and we eventually invested in our first home computer.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Initially, I eyed the &lsquo;gray boxes&rsquo; with acute suspicion but after fiddling with &lsquo;the thing&rsquo; when no one was looking, began to realize the potential of this wonderful new technology.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">We had no access to graphics at that point and the screen produced orange text on a black background.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This was pretty primitive in hindsight but I thought it was wonderful!</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Furthermore, the ability to make flashcards for my pupils without spending hours coin-printing every number and letter made me the envy of my teaching colleagues.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">My interest grew from there and I took every opportunity to learn about computers and their &lsquo;ilk&rsquo;.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">I attended courses in PowerPoint, Windows, Word, Excel and the Internet and slowly gained in confidence and enthusiasm.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">I was one of few teachers in Johannesburg at that time to use a computer for perceptual training and classroom games.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">With one computer set up in a sick room, I started a computer club for interested pupils after school.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Demand grew and soon another second-hand computer was purchased.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">At this stage, I was offered a teaching post at a private school where computers was very much part and parcel of the curriculum.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">I jumped at the chance.</span></p><h1><span class="Apple-style-span">An introduction to the research project</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">In October 2004, two teachers from our school met with Christina Preston and teachers from St Mary&rsquo;s School.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Here she filled us in on the research she was doing for MirandaNet with regards to the impact on Interactive White Boards in teaching and learning.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">At this stage, we&rsquo;d not even seen a picture of one of these &lsquo;miracles&rsquo; and were totally in the dark when we agreed to take part in the MirandaNet research funded by Promethean.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This resulted in a visit to the BETT 2005 and initial training in London.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">What an opportunity and eye-opener that was!</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">None of us had realized the role that ICT was playing in British Education.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">While computers were becoming commonplace in some &lsquo;advantaged schools&rsquo; in South Africa the extent of the resources available to teachers in the British Isles had positively escaped us.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The Exhibition Hall at Olympia was positively overflowing with software of every description.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">And there, in the midst of this hubbub, was the hallowed white board being demonstrated by enthusiastic users.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">We were transfixed, overwhelmed and enthralled.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">For four days we trudged around the show, collecting what ever we could in terms of information and we returned to South Africa with our suitcases bulging at the seams.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">A training stint at the Education Institute near Russell Square days later was much enjoyed.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This gave us an opportunity to meet with people from MirandaNet, Promethean and the Promethean Ambassadors from Mexico, China and Britain.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Dave Jordan arranged for me to visit a small primary school in Croydon where I saw the whiteboard being used in daily lessons.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Valuable networking took place and we returned to our schools enthusiastic and rearing to go only to find that there was some delay in the installation of our board.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">What a disappointment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">This time however, was not wasted.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">It gave us an opportunity to investigate the resources from the Primary National Strategy that we had gleaned during our visit.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">We downloaded the training manual, bound it and set about converting our colleagues.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This has been a rather disappointing exercise.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">We have about twenty teachers that could make use of the white board and only four or five are using it optimally.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The reasons for this will be discussed later in this report.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><h1><span class="Apple-style-span">Getting to grips with the Software</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">One of the most valuable aspects of the Promethean Software is its availability on ones home computer.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This, I believe, is by far the best place to initiate one&rsquo;s own training.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">As in all good teaching, the user needs to start off with some background knowledge and build on this.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">I found the home computer ideal in this respect.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">It allowed me to experiment with the Active Studio tools and the quiet and &lsquo;safety&rsquo; on my own environment.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The first lesson using the actual board can be a daunting experience.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The pupils are excited and &lsquo;geared up&rsquo; and working with the pen is quite different from using the mouse. &ldquo;Just play with it&rdquo; is good advice but this, I found, did not prevent the pitfalls that awaited me at my first white board lesson.</span></p><h1><span class="Apple-style-span">Starting off </span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">Looking back, my initial flipcharts were very simplistic.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This was probably the best start I could have had.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">I teach a Grade One class and in the first term we introduce the very earliest concepts in Maths and Literacy.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">During March, I designed a flipchart to teach initial sounds in phonics, the first words on our basal reader and I also produced an early counting exercise using fish and a background from the Promethean resources.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The pupils adapted without difficulty and were soon dragging objects and writing letters and numbers with confidence and aplomb.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">   </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The reveal tool made its mark by allowing me to introduce the pupils&rsquo; first sentences one by one.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Having scanned in the pictures from their first readers, the children got to know the characters from the New Way series of reading books which are phonics based.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">I have taught this age group for more years that I wish to remember.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Flash cards and photocopied pictures formed the basis of our early resources.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">With the whiteboard however, the possibilities are extended ten-fold.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Coloured graphics and text, the interactive nature of the software and the ease of presentation has without doubt played a huge role in motivating our early readers.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">I have also noticed better results in spelling and phonics that in previous year and I find myself digging into resources that were previously only introduced later in the school year.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span></p><h1><span class="Apple-style-span">An interesting exercises</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">In order to try and establish the value of the Promethean Board, I set up a reading experiment with two Grade One classes.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">A Grade Six class, with the help of word lists and comprehension questionnaires assisted in assessing the pupils both before and after the reading lessons.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The results were very positive.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The scores, drawn up on graphs, showed that those that interacted with the board had better sight word recall and comprehension than the class that had not worked on it.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Similar exercises using the Inspirations Software showed that creative writing also showed improvement and greater maturity. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">Further whiteboard resources were added to as needs arose.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Between May and July, lessons with consonant digraphs such as &lsquo;ck&rsquo;, &lsquo;sh&rsquo; &lsquo;ch&rsquo; and &lsquo;tch&rsquo; were prepared and enjoyed by the children.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">At this time, there was some discussion regarding and AIDS policy at our school.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Very little was available in terms of suitable material for younger children.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This led to the creation of an AIDS presentation via PowerPoint which has been most successful.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">(This particular presentation has been seen by the Curriculum Co-coordinator of our Department of Education and this, with input from the Learning Institute and Linda van der Loo has led indirectly to the creation of a sub-site for the Thutong Web portal for which I will be responsible.)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">This small success has led to me producing other flipcharts that include the life cycle of the butterfly, biology revision for Grade Seven pupils, lessons on communication and ICT as well as mathematical resources for the Middle Phase of the Primary School.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">A difficult concept to teach is place value.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Working with graphics such as crayon boxes and crayons, a very worthwhile lesson was created to this end.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">A similar lesson to teach time, which is also interactive, has also been successful.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">These lessons will be uploaded to our new website shortly and will be available for download both here in South Africa and other interested users. </span></p><h1><span class="Apple-style-span">Difficulties encountered</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">One of the severest stumbling blocks of this wonderful technology is its availability at our school.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The board is situated in a Science Laboratory and access to it is for this reason rather limited.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Access to the computer suite, network, and security needed to be considered when deciding its placement.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Although important considerations, this limits the use by junior primary staff and pupils.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Our school was established some 87 years ago.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Mrs Maud Trennery started the school in her back yard under a small thatched booma. (roof)</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">As the school grew, her house became part of the institution, as did the houses of neighbours on each side.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Soon the entire block was bought up and converted to classrooms.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This meant that the various departments are not under one roof but set in a large garden as individual units.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This involves a considerable walk sometimes in rainy weather to the &lsquo;white board room&rsquo;.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Furthermore, science experiments need to be set up for use by the older girls, and cleared away afterwards.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">One lesson can thus take up three or four periods.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Ideally, each classroom should have its own board and this would ensure that the technology is used to full benefit.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Cost of course is an important deciding factor and somehow funds get routed to other, what the board feels, are more important projects.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">The reluctance of some teachers to embrace new technology is another stumbling block.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Many teachers feel overloaded in terms of the curriculum objectives and others appear to have an innate fear of anything technological.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Training in our country is limited at present although this is something that I would like to endorse and develop in conjunction with Promethean South Africa.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">While I agreed to undertake further training with the staff after staff meetings on Wednesday afternoons, this was one day of the week where teachers were able to get home a little earlier or catch up with other tasks.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This arrangement was for obvious reasons not an ideal situation in terms of training and soon fizzled out.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The staff knows however that I can always be called upon to help where needed.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">I was able to assist Grade 7 girls with IWB projects recently and this was much enjoyed by them all.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">(more on this exercise from Gill Barnard)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">My own training is also fairly limited.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Other than an hour in Cape Town in July, we have had no other formal training.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Most of what has been done has been through self-taught exercises and experimentation.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">I would like to extend my training and in this way develop resources for other teachers throughout South Africa.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This is a considerable possibility with the Thutong portal.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Funds are extremely limited however and I hope to generate funding from Promethean for this project.</span></p><h1><span class="Apple-style-span">My findings</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">The interactivity of the ACTIVboard is making a valuable contribution to my pupils learning.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Early training has taught me the value of the VAKT (visual, auditory, kinesthetic and tactile) method developed by Fernald.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This multisensory approach has proved its worth over the years and I find it an invaluable teaching and learning method.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The boards provide ample stimulus for discussion and the ability to link to useful sites on the web during lessons is an added advantage.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This is particularly useful for second language learners.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">While discussing topics, everyday items that are not always in the realm of the SLL can be illustrated within moments.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">We were discussing the &lsquo;ck&rsquo; digraph and days later had the fortune to read about a yak in a story.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The oddities of our language as well as a visual aid of the animal made an interesting discussion point when we pull it up on the whiteboard and read about the animal&rsquo;s habitat and habits.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">Pupils in the early primary phase have short concentration spans and are extremely egotistical.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Pupils quickly lose interest if they are not directly involved any aspect of a lesson.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">   </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Furthermore, being remedial trained (M Ed special Ed) I often have the task of helping children with special needs.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The ACTIVboard has proved invaluable in these situations.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The old black and white worksheets do not generally have much appeal for these children who don&rsquo;t particularly want to be at an extra lesson anyway!</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The availability of animated graphics and coloured text makes these lesson less daunting and the pupils who have come to extra lessons are finding the time spent on the board a much more enjoyable experience than they did previously.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The ability to provide immediate feedback to these children also adds to their self-esteem.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">Lesson preparation is a pleasure with the ACTIVboard.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Resources can be shared and saved for reinforcement and consolidation at a later date.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Children are going home and investigating topics discussed in class and they are bringing to my notice interesting links to the World Wide Web.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This is extending their learning into the home and involving the parents more.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">It also gives the parents an indication of what is being taught to their children.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">Another useful utility is the ability to print annotations and lessons for children that have been away or merely for record purposes.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Heads of Departments are able to have a clear idea of what is being taught by staff members.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">It is not always easy to judge from typed up lesson plans the progression followed or the methods used.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This &lsquo;record of work&rsquo; can also be viewed by teachers in the next grade and allow them to see clearly what work has been covered.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">Questioning strategies are also enhanced.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">Different possibilities can be explored, questions broken up and answers written down. Open-ended questions also lead to interesting discussions and learning can be extended immediately using the availability of the World Wide Web.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">Assessment with the ACTIVEvote is something we look forward to.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This is not at present available in South Africa but I foresee great things using this technology for we will be able to assess pupils informally according to our new Curriculum Standards.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><h1><span class="Apple-style-span">How has the board affected me personally?</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span">After teaching for some twenty-three years, I was beginning to tire of my profession and was feeling frustrated and unfulfilled in my workplace.</span><span class="Apple-style-span">  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The ACTIVboard has opened unforeseen teaching opportunities and has provided me with a much-needed challenge and inspiration. The possibilities, I feel, are exciting and endless. I will always be a firm advocator of interactive white boards and look forward to exciting and worthwhile lessons using them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoFooter"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><span class="Apple-style-span"> </span></span></p>
