<p><strong>Study</strong></p><h2>Braided Learning &ndash; a theoretical background</h2> <h3>Summary</h3> <p>The professional network of MirandaNet has, over its lifetime since  1992, grown into a mature community of practice that has its own model  of learning and passes that on to new members of the community, and  beyond. The textual basis of this community affords visibility of ideas,  and creation of braided and reflective texts. The community is able to  create interim summaries and re-positionings through braided texts and  continue these into more refined braided artefacts that reach outside  the community. Overall, this community shows a new way of learning &ndash;  braided learning &ndash; that builds on the affordances of digital technology  to effect and support a learning community of practice that can engage  in the highest levels of collaborative thinking, developing theory and  policy.</p> <p>***************************************************************</p> <p>Braided learning is a theory that has emerged from the observation of  modes of online learning as the MirandaNet community of professionals  has matured in digital competence. The MirandaNet Fellowship is a  professional organization of educators, researchers, policy makers, and  developers of software who have a uniting conviction that teaching and  learning can be transformed by the use of digital technologies.  Established in 1992, the Fellows began their association online in 1994.  Over the last 12+ years, MirandaNet has developed into a mature, online  community of practice (Preston, 1999: Preston, 2005: Stuckey, 2005).  This history reveals a three&ndash;dimensional process of learning and  practice that entails coming to understand and participate in a  creative, progressive &lsquo;braiding&rsquo; of text, opinions, and ideas. These  processes reveal how learning by professionals, for the purpose of  strengthening both the profession and individual understanding, unfolds  in the online context.</p> <p>There are three identifiable stages in the process professionals in  MirandaNet adopt and practice in their professional, online, learning.  In the first stage the community engages in creating a braided text  online that supports diversity and change of opinions. Some members act  as e&ndash;facilitators or braiders who help to shape the argument, provide  interim summaries and change the direction of the discussion (Preston,  2002: Cuthell, 2005; Cuthell, 2005; Preston, 2002). These are stored  along with forum discussions and teachers&rsquo; case studies in the  MirandaNet Braided E&ndash;journal (Preston and Cuthell, 2000&ndash;2006). In the  second stage, braiders demonstrate meta&ndash;learning by constructing braided  artefacts, which re&ndash;interpret the online debate in different styles for  different audiences, e.g., newsletters for their local communities and  reports for their school senior management team. In the third stage,  accomplished fellows take the initiative to set up working parties to  explore a subject in more depth. At this point the participants become  active professionals, using collaborative knowledge to build new  theories and policies that will impact their profession in the longer  term (Preston, 2007).</p> <p>The following draws the elements of this braided learning process  together in more detail through an exploration of MirandaNet practice.</p> <h3>A community of practice as a nucleus of learning</h3> <p>This concept of a Community of Practice (CoP) is key to understanding  how braided learning works online. The term CoPs was coined by Lave and  Wenger (1991) with acknowledgement that it refers to a human process of  working and learning together that has been operating for centuries  (e.g., as in medieval craft guilds). However, newly explored in a  socio&ndash;cultural context, the concept provides a useful perspective on  knowing, learning and knowledge building in professional life, and has  been particularly useful for online contexts for focusing attention on  the interests and practices that keep communities together rather than  just the geographical co&ndash;location (see also Wenger, 1998; and the  sections in this paper by Kazmer, and by Montague).</p> <p>MirandaNet is such a community of practice. It has been described by  researchers as a CoP &ldquo;with an active and passionate core&rdquo; (Stuckey,  2006, p. 66), and in a UNESCO report as a successful CoP that effects  change in teaching and learning worldwide, using digital access to  provide a platform for the disenfranchised:</p> <p>Such collaborative problem solving is important to many ICT teacher  educators, who have relatively little access to technical support or to  view new developments. Exchange visits between countries have  strengthened community members&rsquo; resolve. The exchange of information is  two way, as it flows from the wealthy to the less well resourced and  back again. (Resta, 2002, p. 29)</p> <p>MirandaNet&rsquo;s CoP is founded on voluntary, informal participation, and  active, directed learners. Members decide on their learning agenda  rather than waiting passively to be taught from a curriculum decided by  others. This active learning accords with Sachs&rsquo; (2003) belief that  educators, like doctors, should be active professionals closely involved  in the development of policy and practice (MacGilchrist, et al., 1997).  In MirandaNet, this active practice moves further out into the  community as educators in the more mature stage of their collaborative,  braided learning come to influence professional policy and create  theories and policies of their own.</p> <h3>Staged models of learning</h3> <p>Braided learning joins other models and research that describe stages  in online learning (e.g., Salmon, 2000, 2002; Haythornthwaite, Kazmer,  Robins and Shoemaker, 2000) and/or group dynamics, but differs in  representing a community that is not delimited by the need to complete a  course, write a final exam, or deliver a product. Braided learning does  have in common with these models stages relating to access, motivation  and socialization in joining the community, exchange of information and  experience relevant to the joint venture, development of joint practice,  and development of shared meaning. In particular, Braided Learning is  grounded in Salmon&rsquo;s seminal five&ndash;stage model for online learning,  developed in relation to business courses (see <a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml">http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml</a>).</p> <p>Salmon&rsquo;s stages address:</p> <ul><li>Individual access and motivation to use computer&ndash;mediated communication</li><li>Online socialization and formulation of online identities</li><li>Information exchange among learners relevant to the courses</li><li>Knowledge construction through collaborative discussion and interaction</li><li>Development of meta&ndash;thinking and application of knowledge and online  skills to learners&rsquo; goals and purposes that are often exam related.</li></ul> <p>Observation of MirandaNet practice shows that both individual  members, and the CoP as a whole, progress through stages of access,  motivation and online socialisation, information exchange, and  collaborative knowledge and meta&ndash;knowledge building. Braided learning  processes begin to appear when members engage with MirandaNet, revealing  who they are. As a community, the relevance of such disclosures was  recognized after a few years, and profiles for members, which would now  be called blogs, were introduced in 1999. They continue in the  information exchange stage when members begin to publish their case  studies and articles in MirandaNet&rsquo;s e&ndash;journals. The CoP as a whole  began to see and benefit from this kind of publication in 1999. Although  braided learning begins in these stages, its most important  contributions come in the stage of collaborative knowledge building.  Thus, Braided Learning as a theory of learning practice most  significantly addresses the way in which knowledge is jointly  construction through online texts created by and for their fellow CoP  members. In MirandaNet, this kind of learning has been observed since  2000, when the community had gained a mature capacity to use the  listserv to enrich their professional learning.</p> <h3>Braided learning stages</h3> <p><strong>Stage One: Braided text</strong></p> <p>The first evidence of Braided Learning is the appearance of braided  text. Debates can be started by any member on any subject relevant to  the group. In these braided digital exchanges, members interweave their  comments, judgments and evidence to create shared insights, which have  influence on current professional thinking, formally or informally.  (Text is the primary medium of exchange in MirandaNet as it provides a  means that is accessible to as many users as possible; it is possible  that, in the future, communities may see braiding occurring in use of  other means of communication).</p> <p>This dynamic process of braiding depends on trust between the  participants, plus humour and passion; it builds over years with  knowledge of past exchanges that cannot be communicated easily to the  outsider. This kind of online closed publication can support  contradictions and disagreements. Conflicts are not necessarily smoothed  over or resolved in the pursuit of greater understanding. Nor is the  style homogenised, as it might be in a more public presentation.  Individual approaches can be recognised which is not possible in  official publications or reports.</p> <p>This stage of building a collaborative online text is a form of  learning by collaborative knowledge building. Members learn by  participating in this jointly owned braided text, and by observing the  process. There is evidence of learning when particular participants post  about their increase in knowledge on the topic or about a change of  opinion as a result of the online debate. The validity of the text  depends on the full membership of the e&ndash;community having immediate input  to the debate online.</p> <p>Braiding, in the form of posting evidence of learning, is of key  importance to this CoP. Without posting about learning, i.e., without  reflection on what has been gained from online discussion, the texts  remain undistinguished and no more collaborative than a question and  answer forum. Braiding is important as more than an image; weaving  individual threads of text together makes a stronger knowledge fabric,  one that represents, and creates the representation of the community as a  whole.</p> <p><strong>Learning to braid text</strong></p> <p>In MirandaNet senior Fellows contribute by promoting braiding. They  run courses for learner&ndash;braiders in order to enrich the group  discussion. Others volunteer for this role either because they have the  confidence as senior members or they have a natural talent for  understanding how braiding is done and when the skill is needed.  Braiders may show their meta&ndash;learning by changing the direction of the  debate or bringing it back to the subject; they may summarise the debate  at various stages to remind the participants what has happened or draw  out the conclusions signalling the end of the period of online  collaborative knowledge construction. These braiders also encourage  reluctant discussants to explore their theme further, calm the agitated  and revitalise areas of discussion by clever questions that suggest they  know less than they actually do &mdash; all good teaching techniques. The  difference is that the braider cannot see the participants and must,  therefore, be more sensitive to other clues. The braiding helps to  clarify aspects of the e&ndash;community vision on a particular topic and  increase a sense of participation and ownership.</p> <p><strong>Stage Two: Braided artefacts</strong></p> <p>The second stage of braided learning is associated with Salmon&rsquo;s  fifth stage of development. In this stage braiders reinterpret text for a  variety of purposes, creating a braided artefact. MirandaNet braiders  create these texts for those outside their CoP, reaching a wide range of  audiences depending on the circumstances of the braider. Such artefacts  are also often summarised for the MirandaNet online newsletter and  archive, which means they also reach and act as example for the CoP  members as well.</p> <p><strong>Stage Three: Influencing and making policy</strong></p> <p>There is a third stage of learning in which the braiders,  individually or in groups, learn to use the braided artifacts that  express the meta&ndash;thinking of the group to have influence over the  policies which affect them professionally locally, nationally and  internationally. The speed of creation and the international outreach of  MirandaNet braided artifacts have group authority that is enhanced by  the reach of digital technologies, and the permanence of the online  archives.</p> <p>Some artefacts have been used as the basis of an article in the  educational technologies section of a national newspaper. For example, a  synthesis of a debate about the reasons for a sudden reduction in the  numbers of regional advisers in digital technology in England was  reported in the U.K. Guardian newspaper. Other artefacts have been used  by teachers in reports written to influence the decisions of senior  managers. For example, an ICT coordinator summarised the advice he was  given about social software on school networks to inform the head  teacher who was threatening to close down these network services.  Another artefact was sent to the government in response to a request for  contributions to a consultative document on e&ndash;learning (Department for  Education and Skills (U.K.), 2003). Since members come from 43 countries  these patterns are repeated internationally.</p> <p>Moreover, some uses suggest that braiders are not just influencing  policy, but are also creating new theories and policies. For instance,  sometimes working groups are convened as a result of a braided artefact  composed by a member who wants to take the topic further. These working  groups then raise funding to explore the subject more thoroughly in  research projects. They build face&ndash;to&ndash;face events into the funding  whenever this is viable because collaboration at this level online  requires high levels of group understanding and trust. Although young  learners may be able to strike up this kind of relationship entirely  online, MirandaNet professionals find they still need some social  interaction to underpin collaborative theorising. At this point the  professionals begin to create policy and theory through their evidence,  rather than merely influencing the policies developed by others. At this  third and final stage the braiders emerge as active professionals,  taking charge of their professional destiny.</p> <p>The information above is an extract from a First Monday paper by  Caroline Haythornthwaite: Volume 12, Number 8 &ndash; 6 August 2007 &ndash; Articles</p> <p>For references email : christina@mirandanet.ac.uk or refer to the paper below</p> <p>Theories and models of and for online learning</p> <p>Caroline Haythornthwaite, Richard Andrews, Michelle M. Kazmer, Bertram C. Bruce, Rae-Anne Montague, Christina Preston</p> <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>For many years, discussion of online learning, or e-learning, has  been pre-occupied with the practice of teaching online and the debate  about whether being online is &lsquo;as good as&rsquo; being offline. The authors  contributing to this paper see this past as an incubation period for the  emergence of new teaching and learning practices. We see changes in  teaching and learning emerging from the nexus of a changing landscape of  information and communication technologies, an active and motivated  teaching corps that has worked to derive new approaches to teaching, an  equally active and motivated learning corps that has contributed as much  to how to teach online as they have to how to learn while online, with  others, and away from a campus setting. We see the need for, and the  emergence of, new theories and models of and for the online learning  environment, addressing learning in its ICT context, considering both  formal and informal learning, individual and community learning, and new  practices arising from technology use in the service of learning. This  paper presents six theoretical perspectives on learning in ICT contexts,  and is an invitation to others to bring theoretical models to the fore  to enhance our understanding of new learning contexts.</p> <p><a href="http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/search/authors/view?firstName=Caroline&amp;middleName=&amp;lastName=Haythornthwaite&amp;affiliation=">http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/search/authors/view?firstName=Caroline&amp;middleName=&amp;lastName=Haythornthwaite&amp;affiliation=</a></p>
