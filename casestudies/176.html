    <h2>Report on the IWB project in Beijing</h2>
<p><strong>Beijing Academy of Educational Sciences</strong></p>

<p><strong>Year of posting:</strong> 2006</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>This report is an update of our project proposal.<br />
<hr />
<p><strong>Study</strong></p>March 22, 2006<br /> 1. Background<br /> ICT can make significant contribution to teaching and learning. It is a new teaching tendency to use Interactive Whiteboards (IWB) to promote the transformation of teaching and learning. With such a consensus, Beijing Academy of Educational Sciences (BAES) and the company of Promethean and Mirandanet Fellowship will jointly initiate a collaborative project on applying IWB in Beijing schools. For this, Mirandanet has agreed to offer two sets of IWB including electronic projectors, relevant facilities and teaching resources, as well as professional technique services to support the project for free.<br /> One facility will be installed in BAES to provide IWB training for teachers in primary and secondary schools in Beijing. The other will be installed in Beijing No. 50 Secondary School to conduct experiments in classroom teaching.<br /> This project was made on the agreement between BAES and the company of Promethean &amp; Mirandanet Fellowship.<br /> In the June of 2005, in order to benefit more schools in Beijing the company of Promethean provided IWB at half price after BAES had negotiated with Promethean. Till then, there are eleven schools&nbsp; including the 50th Secondary school had installed IWB, and four of them&nbsp; have used one or two boards for teaching before.<br /> At present, there are eight IWB projected schools including the 50th middle school in Beijing. Because of the problem in transportation and installation, the installation of IWB in those schools was finished until the end of 2005. The projected teachers just started to use the IWB, some only have got training, some have used for 1 to 3 months, but majority have not got the opportunity for training, so the task for training is still significant.<br /> 2. Methodology<br /> In order to study the applicability of IWB in class in Beijing, and the effects of using IWB to transfer teaching and learning, BAES carried on the survey in two secondary schools and one primary school within eleven project schools. The two secondary schools are the 50th middle school using IWB for ten months and the 14th middle schools using IWB for nearly two years; the primary school has used IWB for 3 to 4 months.<br /> Because the use of IWB has just started, only minor teachers and students participated in the survey. Small number of the questionnaires are recalled, 20 for teachers and 129 for students.<br /> Besides the survey, BAES has observed lessons, organized discussions about the use of IWB in teaching, and collected the data from teachers and students.<br /> The following are our research results<br /> 3&pound;&AElig; Data analysis<br /> 3.11 About the teachers: In the project schools, IWB is used in Math, English, Chinese, Geography, Complex practice, Physics, Chemistry, Art and so on especially in Math and English occupying 60%. The average age of the teachers is 31, and the average teaching experience is nine years.<br /> 3.12. About Installation of IWB:&nbsp; In Most of the project schools in Beijing, IWB is installed in special classroom, because they only have several pieces of IWB. &nbsp;<br /> 3.13 About Using IWB: According to the investigation, 57.9% of the teachers use IWB only once or twice, 15.8% use it at least once a month, and the other 15.8% use it at least once a week. So IWB is not commonly used, and teachers still prefer the traditional blackboard.<br /> &nbsp; In NO. 50 Secondary school, 62.5% of teachers use IWB once or twice, 12.5% use it at least once a week, and 12.5% use it at least once a day.<br /> According to the feedback from students in the three schools, 68.5% students said that their teachers seldom used IWB, which is similar to result in teachers&rsquo; survey.<br /> 3.14&pound;&AElig;About Training for IWB: 50% of the teachers could master the basic skills after one or two days&rsquo; training, 16.7% needs three or four days training, while the others needs more time. <br /> 3.2Feedback from Teachers<br /> 3.21 The data shows that IWB are appreciated by most of teachers in the following aspects. &nbsp;<br /> Table 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> Item<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are there any advantages from IWB compared with blackboard .&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&pound;&reg;%&pound;&copy;agreement percentage<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All the teachers&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The 14th middle school&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The 50th middle school<br /> 1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Promoting the interactivity and communication between teachers and students, and between students themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;Being easily and conveniently operated.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;83.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;70.0&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;75.0<br /> &nbsp; Comparing the feedback from NO.14 with 50 Secondary Schools, which uses IWB for two years and ten months respectively in Table 1, we can conclude that the longer the teachers use, the more advantages the teachers get, especially in transferring traditional teaching.<br /> &nbsp;3.22 The data shows that IWB are positively commented by part of teachers in the following aspects.<br /> Table 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> Item&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are there any advantages from IWB compared with blackboard. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;agreement percentage<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All the teachers&nbsp;&nbsp;

It is the gradual process to improve the students&rsquo; achievements using IWB.<br /> 4.Conclusion<br /> 4.1 Teaching with IWB not only supported didactic, catches students&rsquo; attention, inspires students&rsquo; interest by the main tools toolbox, but also transform learning and teaching, makes the teaching more easily. There is more evidence in primary school than junior high school.<br /> 4.2 The more time they have lessons with IWB, the more interactive their learning is, and the less the visual effect they have, which help to change traditional pedagogy into interactive learning and teaching.<br /> 4.3 The more time the teachers use IWB in the lesson, the much clever and be good at using the resource library they have. And the teachers said when they prepare the lesson using IWB they could save the time a little. And also it is useful to review for the teachers&rsquo; development.<br /> 4.4 Although we don&rsquo;t have enough evidence to prove the students&rsquo; achievements in such a short time, which is a gradual process, there are already some evidences showing that the more time the students have lesson using IWB, the more evidence the students have in impacting student&rsquo;s thinking and ability.<br /> 5. Problems which need to improved <br /> 5.1 The pen, which right key and double click do not work well, not sensitive enough, and broken easily.<br /> 5.2 IWB could not match with some laptop. <br /> 5.3 Frequently changing between EIWB and other software causes breakdown.<br /> 5.4 The resource library is all in English, which is the largest obstacle to its use in China. We need resources more appropriate for Chinese.<br /> 5.5 The schools in Beijing suggest that teaching with IWB be proper for the class size with less than forty students. <br /> 5.6 The students at the front can not endure the bright light.<br /> &nbsp;Questionnaire for teachers<br /> Dear teachers<br /> The Questionnaire is designed research only, your answers will be kept secret.<br /> There are some options after the questions, you should mark the most proper one with &deg;&infin;&deg;&Atilde;&deg;&plusmn;in &deg;&infin;&deg;&#305;&deg;&plusmn;.Thanks for your support!<br /> IWB Project<br /> 02-2006<br /> <br /> 101.The type of your school <br /> &deg;&#305;&pound;&reg;1&pound;&copy;Middle school.&nbsp; &deg;&#305;&pound;&reg;2&pound;&copy;Secondary School &deg;&#305;&pound;&reg;3&pound;&copy;High school&deg;&#305;&pound;&reg;4&pound;&copy;&ndash;&deg;&mdash;&szlig;&deg;&pound;Primary school<br /> 102.
