    <h2>Teacher mentoring</h2>
<p><strong>Sarah Fletcher</strong></p>
<p><strong>Year of posting:</strong> 2005</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p><p><strong>Sarah Fletcher</strong></p><p>International Consultant in Educational Mentoring<br />Senior Lecturer in Mentoring and Induction (secondary sector),<br />Department of Continuing Professional Development,<br />School of Education,<br />Bath Spa University,<br />Newton Park Campus,<br />Bath BA2 9BN</p><p><a href="http://www.teacherresearch.net/">http://www.TeacherResearch.net</a><br /><a href="http://www.mentorresearch.net/">http://www.MentorResearch.net</a><br /><a href="http://www.studentsresearch.net/">http://www.StudentsResearch.net</a></p><p><strong>Personal Statement</strong></p><p>I am a passionate teacher and mentor! I taught young people between the ages of 8 and 19&nbsp; in schools in several parts of England between 1973 and 1994 and my subject areas were diverse &ndash; French, Spanish, English, History, Geography, RE, Art and Craft, Maths, Environmental Studies and very occasionally PE (not well!)&nbsp; I came from the classroom to higher education fired with a desire to hear teachers&rsquo; voice valued in higher education.</p><p>I was puzzled that much of what I read as a new academic did not seem to be very related to my own experience as a teacher.&nbsp; I became a mentor in 1992 for overseas teachers in the Licensed Teacher Scheme and as Head of Faculty in an upper school in Bedfordshire soon became mentor to many other colleagues and realised good mentoring is two-way.</p><p>It&rsquo;s almost impossible to say where my personal and professional interest diverge &ndash; for I teach what I love and I love what I teach.&nbsp; My interest in photography has sparked off my use of video and digital stills work in mentoring and my shaky skills in tailoring led me to become a needlework teacher alongside teaching French in a middle school in Suffolk. </p><p>My enjoyment of gardening resulted in running a mini enterprise project with children in a school greenhouse, growing plants for sale to parents and lettuces to the school canteen!</p><p>I&rsquo;ve had and, despite illness, continue to have a wonderfully fulfilling career in education.</p><p><strong>ICT Interests</strong></p><p>My consuming interest is the construction of websites to assist teachers, mentors and students as researchers.&nbsp; In 2002, I worked with my friend John Hewitt to construct a website at <a href="http://www.teacherresearch.net/">http://www.TeacherResearch.net</a> because I had been fortunate to work with almost 70 teachers in total who secured Best Practice Research Scholarships and I wanted to provide them (and me!) with a resource to inform, support and disseminate their work.</p><p>I have learnt so much working alongside teachers as an action research mentor and it is a continuing source of excitement for me to see teachers representing their knowledge.</p><p>I offer an open invitation to teachers to send me their research so that it can be posted to my website and I am delighted to announce that my website was NGFL badged in 2005.</p><p>My intention is to offer opportunities for teachers to learn how to engage with action research through mentoring in a way that will assist them, and their students, to learn.</p><p>This summer, 2005, I was offered the opportunity to work with a new group of teacher researchers at Bitterne Park School in Southampton and we agreed that we would work together to create web-based accounts of the teachers&rsquo; learning about action research and research mentoring.&nbsp; We have used the Carnegie Foundation KEEP Toolkit templates and I hope you agree that these teachers&rsquo; work in content and layout is simply breathtaking!</p><p>You can see further examples on TeacherResearch.net but these 2 really caught my eye:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.cfkeep.org/html/snapshot.php?id=51952540922866">http://www.cfkeep.org/html/snapshot.php?id=51952540922866</a></li><li>http://www.cfkeep.org/html/snapshot.php?id=40142960511281</li></ul><p>Essentially my website is my c.v. and my hope and intention is find a way to develop an interactive database for teachers&rsquo; research so that it can be engaged with alongside more traditional forms of academic enquiry.&nbsp; You can see my justification for developing such a resource in the PowerPoint that I co-presented with John Hewitt at Becta&rsquo;s Research Conference in June 2005 accessible at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.teacherresearch.net/ne_national.htm">http://www.teacherresearch.net/ne_national.htm</a></p><p>My wish, in joining the Mirandanet Fellowship, is to contribute to the pool of research into practice in all aspects of mentoring, using ICT to enable and support communication.</p><p><strong>Publications </strong></p><p>Fletcher, S.J.

All the participants are engaged in the development of communities of practice which rely on the internet for e-facilitated learning and e-publication. The activities of these reflective communities have been researched from a range of perspectives. The international MirandaNet community is explored in depth with three examples of the mode of operation. The MirandaNet model is compared and contrasted with other communities of practice being developed between China, Croatia, South Africa and The Netherlands. Ementoring and efacilitation are Important new skills which have been mastered by the members of these communities. Practice based research is the main teaching method which is discussed where teachers identify an educational problem they would like to solve by using new media as a catalyst for change in teaching and learning. These new kinds of learning require innovative assessment methods. The symposium presents research into the development of a tool kit which can be used to scaffold the project management tasks demanded b=y practice based research.</p><p>Sarah Fletcher </p><p>Practice based research provides the medium in this paper for professional cultural exchange between colleagues in China, Croatia and across the UK. The focus is on the&nbsp; web-pages created by teachers as they become action research mentors for one another. Findings indicate practice can be improved by this reflective international interchange.</p><p><strong /></p>
