<p><strong>Study</strong></p>  <h2>Mapping: What&rsquo;s it all about?</h2>   <p> By <a href="../profiles/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=1.html">Christina Preston</a></p>   <p> <em>Visual thinking and learning tools such as Mind Mapping and Concept      Mapping are making an impact in today&rsquo;s classrooms. Christina Preston,      Founder and Chair of the MirandaNet Fellowship, explains what the concept      is, how it is helping students and how ICT is taking it to new levels.</em></p>   <h3> What is visual learning?</h3>   <p>Visual learning is a proven teaching method in which diagrams such as concept      maps, mind maps, tree diagrams, organisation charts and spider diagrams are      used to help students of all ages think and learn more effectively. They are      all used for storing, processing, organising and presenting information graphically.      These techniques are used across the curriculum and at all Key Stages in the      UK. The most popular are Concept Mapping and Mind Mapping.</p>   <h3>What is Concept Mapping?</h3>   <p>The Concept Mapping technique was developed by Prof. Joseph D. Novak at Cornell      University in the 1960s. Concept maps graphically illustrate relationships      between information. In a concept map, two or more concepts are linked by      words that describe their relationship.</p>   <p>Concept maps encourage understanding by helping students to organise and      enhance their knowledge on any topic. They help students learn new information      by integrating each new idea into their existing body of knowledge. </p>   <p>Concept maps are ideal for measuring the growth of student learning. As students      create concept maps, they reiterate ideas using their own words. Misdirected      links or wrong connections can alert teachers to gaps or misunderstandings      in their students&rsquo; knowledge. In this way concept mapping provides an      accurate, objective way to evaluate particular areas requiring additional      explanation to complete students&rsquo; understanding. </p>   <p class="centeredImage"><img src="../images/waves_map.jpg" alt="Concept Map of Waves using Inspiration" title="Concept Map of Waves using Inspiration" width="363" height="329" />    </p>   <p class="centeredImage">Concept Map on Waves using Inspiration</p>   <h3>What is Mind Mapping?</h3>   <p>Mind Mapping&reg; was first coined in the UK by Tony Buzan in his 1974 book      and BBC TV programme &ldquo;Use Your Head&rdquo;. A mind map is a visual representation      of hierarchical information. Students follow a process of building a mind      map, to represent an entire concept or an idea with branches of associated      thoughts. As with other visual learning techniques, mind maps provide a simplified      overview of complex information allowing students to better understand relationships      and to find new connections. </p>   <p>Mind maps include a central idea or image surrounded by branches of associated      topics or ideas. Subtopics are then added to the branches as ideas flow freely.      Typically in a mind map, topic and subtopic text is one to two keywords, to      provide a reminder for what the idea is. More information is then detailed      in attached notes. </p>   <p>Mind mapping is a commonly used tool for brainstorming and note taking. The      process of building a mind map is very fluid and nonlinear, making the expansion      of ideas similar to the natural way of thinking. Symbols and images, along      with keywords, are used to quickly retain and recall information. Branches      are often in different colours to help students to remember the different      branches and their associations.</p>   <p class="centeredImage"><img src="../images/mind_map.gif" alt="Mind Map of a Newscast using Inspiration" title="Mind Map of a Newscast using Inspiration" width="350" height="294" />    </p>   <p class="centeredImage">Mind Map of a Newscast using Inspiration</p>   <h3>How does Mind Mapping and Concept Mapping support learning?</h3>   <p>The use of visual learning techniques, such as mapping, is achieving growing      recognition in education. Whether we believe that the mind is organised into      left and right-hand sides, or whether it is a less organised structure of      various skills, mapping utilises a greater part of the brain, resulting in      more effective thinking. Imagination and association are the keys to high-level      memory and creative thinking and mapping supports this. With many students      being visual or kinaesthetic learners, this approach makes the teaching more      enjoyable and effective and the learning more successful and fun. It is an      educational win&ndash;win that multiplies its benefits over time and with      use.</p>   <p>Concept maps and mind maps are quick to review and it is easy to refresh      information in the mind just by glancing at one. Remembering the shape and      structure of a visual diagram can provide cues necessary to remember the information      within it. They engage much more of the brain in the process of assimilation      and connecting facts than conventional notes or summaries.</p>   <h3> How does ICT take Concept Mapping and Mind Mapping further?</h3>   <p>The application of ICT can act as a catalyst for change in teaching and learning.      In terms of visual learning, technology takes the student from a 2D paper      based map into a multi-layered environment. </p>   <p>With ICT Visual Learning tools:</p>   <ul>     <li>Graphics and symbols can be used to highlight the nodes</li>     <li>Labels that can be attached to the links</li>     <li>Maps can easily be re-organised in a variety of ways to make the picture        clear</li>     <li>Maps can be hyperlinked to other maps creating a complex multi-layered        system for understanding an idea</li>     <li>Elements within the map can be &ldquo;hyperlinked&rdquo; to files, websites        and other digital resources</li>     <li>Multimedia files, such as MP3 and Movie files, could be inserted and played        directly from the document</li>     <li>Cross curricular templates and resources so that teacher and students        can get started quickly</li>   </ul>   <p>ICT also helps to support the development of higher order thinking skills.      Inspiration&reg; (Ages 7 to adult) and Kidspiration&reg; (for students age      4-10 years) have been designed specially for the education market, and the      latest version of Inspiration includes access to more than one million symbols      to help visualise ideas. MirandaNet fellows have been researching how younger      children learn to use both language and images to make meaning of the world      and also how children source and choose the images to represent their ideas.      New multimedia functionality also enables students to insert and play video      and sound directly from their maps to enrich projects. </p>   <p>Inspiration features three unique learning environments which mean that students      can build their diagrams, concept or mind maps and then transfer them into      text outlines. This means that students who may struggle to get their thoughts      down in a linear way can pour all their ideas onto the page, reorganise them,      link them up and, by transferring to the outline view, have the satisfaction      of seeing their ideas made into a structured story or argument. Teachers have      commented on how this can raise the self esteem of students who struggle with      writing, especially with boys who are initially engaged by the ICT aspect      of this way of working but who come out of the process having gained valuable      thinking and learning skills. Inspirations Word Guide, dictionary and thesaurus      also aid writing and literacy by giving students more scope for expression.    </p>   <p>These ICT tools can also enhance the experience for auditory learners. Inspiration      and Kidspiration both have audio tools which allow auditory learners to see      their ideas visually as well as hearing the words spoken aloud. The listen      tool reads aloud any text a student inputs. The record tool allows emerging      writers to record their own words and hear it spoken aloud. Last but not least      the talking interface will read aloud all program elements to the students,      so if a student scrolls over an item anywhere in the program, the voice will      say it aloud making Inspiration and Kidspiration great tools for audio and      visual learners.</p>   <p>Ultimately, ICT allows you to expand your ideas by visualising connections      and concepts, in a way that you cannot on paper. With paper based mapping      you can run out of space or find it is frustrating to add ideas or move them      around. The functionality of ICT means that the area for expression is expanded      so that space issues do not get in the way of the thought process. </p>   <p>The choice between concept mapping and mind mapping is one of personal preference;      however what is clear is that ultimately teachers seem to agree that both      are powerful thinking skills that can offer benefits to all students. What      is also clear is that using ICT to undertake this process has the potential      to extend the flexibility and scope of this approach even further.</p>   <p>Inspiration Version 8, launched March 2006, is available through <a href="http://www.taglearning.co.uk/">TAG      Learning</a> on 01474 357350 or at <a href="http://www.taglearning.co.uk/">www.taglearning.co.uk</a>.
