<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p><p>Cultures of learning are changing world-wide in this digital age.  Conventional understanding of mobile learning, a useful term for  digitally-mediated, multimodal learning, is usually framed in terms of  devices that are not tied to specific physical locations: laptops; data  loggers; PDAs, smart phones; netbooks and an increasing range of  products that link learning to classrooms and curricula. Multimodality  in this context means meaning-making through signs that include sound,  gestures, animation, graphics, body language and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Study</strong></p><h1>Mobile Learning Conference March 2009</h1> <h3>New professional cultures : braided gatherings in The Third Space</h3> <p><em>Christina Preston, John Cuthell, Theo Keuchel, Leon Cych, Dai Thomas, Drew Buddie and Allison Allen, MirandaNet Fellowship</em></p> <p>Cultures of learning are changing world-wide in this digital age.  Conventional understanding of mobile learning, a useful term for  digitally-mediated, multimodal learning, is usually framed in terms of  devices that are not tied to specific physical locations: laptops; data  loggers; PDAs, smart phones; netbooks and an increasing range of  products that link learning to classrooms and curricula. Multimodality  in this context means meaning-making through signs that include sound,  gestures, animation, graphics, body language and so on.</p> <p>Whilst learning remotely and informally is largely is what has been  understood about mobile learning, we can now extend the concept to  include the informal spaces in which learning takes place &ndash; the liminal  spaces that those who push the boundaries of digital possibilities now  inhabit intellectually. In discussing educators, Zeichner speaks of the  Third Space to denote democratic sharing of professional resources and  practices (Zeichner and Liston 2006; Zeichner 2008). This is a useful  term to denote liminal spaces for educators.</p> <p>The value of developing a web-based Third Space in a &lsquo;community of  practice&rsquo;(Lave and Wenger 1991) is highlighted in by digitally  experienced teachers and advisers who are  members of the professional  organisations: Naace, MirandaNet and ITTE. These teachers and advisers  who responded to a study about Continuing Professional Development in  digital technologies explained that in these communities of practice  (CoPs) social networking cultures were already established, although the  majority of the members still confined their activities to email list  discussions (Preston and Cuthell 2007).</p> <p>From observations of the online activities in the Third Space of  these three CoPs, an emergent model called Braided Learning has been  developed that highlights the ways in which members of professional CoPs  are developing the affordances of mobile learning for themselves  (Cuthell 2005; Haythornthwaite 2007; Preston 2008 ). The braided  metaphor describes processes of building collaborative knowledge using  Web 2.0. The framework reveals a three&ndash;dimensional process of learning  and practice that entails coming to understand and participate in a  creative, progressive &lsquo;braiding&rsquo; of text, opinions, and ideas. These  processes reveal how learning by professionals, for the purpose of  strengthening both the profession and individual understanding, unfolds  in the online context.</p> <p>There are three identifiable stages in the process professionals  adopt and practice in their professional, online, learning. In the first  stage the CoP engages in creating a braided text online that supports  diversity and change of opinions. Some members act as e&ndash;facilitators or  braiders who help to shape the argument, provide interim summaries and  change the direction of the discussion. In the second stage, braiders  demonstrate meta&ndash;learning by constructing braided artefacts, which  re&ndash;interpret the online debate in different styles for different  audiences. In the third stage, accomplished fellows take the initiative  to set up working parties to explore a subject in more depth. At this  point the participants become active professionals, using collaborative  knowledge to build new theories and policies. Collaborative publication  is a key goal in order to impact on policy in the longer term.</p> <p>Increasingly, these members of CoPs are shaping liminal spaces to  fulfil their own professional needs. Most recently Braided Learning  theory is being applied to emerging MirandaMod programme that is a  modification of &lsquo;unconferencing&rsquo;. Wikipedia defines the term  &ldquo;unconference&rdquo; as applied, or self-applied, to a wide range of  gatherings that try to avoid one or more aspects of a conventional  conference, such as high fees, travel costs, sponsored presentations.</p> <p>In MirandaNet such an unconference is called MirandaMod, an informal,  loosely structured unconference of like-minded educators to share ideas  about the use of technology to inspire others. Historically; Mod comes  from the Gaelic word for a gathering, assembly or parliament. MirandMod  is usually (but not always) a fringe event following or attached to a  formal MirandaNet seminar/workshop or meeting. The Wiki-based format,  with streamed webcasts, chat facilities and linked Twitter streams, mean  that there is an international dimension to these events. Like wikis,  blogs, chat and email, this online multimodal communication is unlike  previous modes of knowledge construction because remote participation  reduces time and cost commitments. In these unstructured activities  software such as Flash Meeting linked to microblogging and instant  communication streams empowers digital visitors to engage remotely with  those at the terrestrial meetings, even to the point of placing a  convivial beer next to their terminal. Second Life is also being  considered as a welcoming MirandaMod location. Pilot evaluation using  the Daly and Pachler indicators is already suggesting evidence of a  sense of community, meta-learning and knowledge construction. (Daly and  Pachler 2007)</p> <p>What is important about this knowledge creation activity, however, is  that the technology is sufficiently transparent to empower all members  to set agenda at the grassroots. This mirrors young peoples&rsquo; mobile  learning activity outside school in easy to use virtual environments  like ThinkQuest, Beebo and Facebook that allow them to follow their  interests and exploits their existing talents. Significantly MirandaMods  encourages democratic debate rather than promoting socialisation. These  MirandaMods challenge the usual model of conferences for teachers where  there is limited interaction, if any, between &lsquo;experts&rsquo; on stage and  the expert audience. In the MirandaMod professionals have equal input  regardless of their differing status in the world of education.  PowerPoint is discouraged, and each participant who has a seven minute  spot is chosen on the night by software designed with a fruit machine  interface that underpins the random selection. The iChat text, video  stream and Twitter feed is then posted in the MirandaNet Third Space so  that those who could not participate have a record of proceedings.  Currently this material is also being used for research in order to  develop the Braided Learning framework more comprehensively.</p> <p>The MirandaMod is proving valuable in the creation of professional  knowledge as opposed to socialising online. This instant communication  between work-based experts is a valuable mode of professional learning,  where all the participants define the agenda during the event. Unlike a  more formal event, innovation can be reported as it happens even though  it is not, perhaps, fully worked out. This gives a chance for other  members of the CoP to comment whilst new developments are in progress.  It also gives publication value to the kind of expert knowledge that  teachers&rsquo; are unlikely to commit to a full academic paper.</p> <p>MirandaMod pilots, held at an exhibition called BETT09, are now being  analysed to see whether this emerging mode of communication might now  offer innovative and engaging opportunities for professional knowledge  creation in the areas of Visual Literacy, Communities of Practice and  Mobile Learning. The hope is that these new modes of learning can be  implemented explicitly within work-based Continuing Professional  Development programmes for teachers. This will provide more  professionals with access to processes of knowledge creation through the  application of mobile learning affordances.</p> <p>The latest MirandaMod multimodal texts can be found on <a href="../mirandamods/index.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/mirandamod</a></p> <p>Thanks to Norbert Pachler for permission to publish this article<br /> co-director of the WLE centre<br /> <a href="http://www.wlecentre.ac.uk/">http://www.wlecentre.ac.uk</a></p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong><br /> Cuthell, J.
