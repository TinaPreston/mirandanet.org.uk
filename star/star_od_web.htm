    <p><strong>Background</strong><br>
      The Holy Cross School is a Catholic High School, formerly called Holy Cross 
      Convent School. As part of the STAR Project, we were involved in discussions 
      with Joe Kolecki, NASA Pathfinder scientist, on many levels. </p>
    <p>Letter from Ali to Joe:</p>
    <p>Dear Joe,</p>
    <p>Hello! How are you? I hope everything is going well for you, and for all 
      the other members of the STAR team.</p>
    <p>My name is Alicia, Ali for short, and I am a student from Mr. Williams&#8217; 
      Year 12 English Language class, which is currently working on the STAR programme 
      in order to aid our studies in several subject areas, including Information 
      and Communication Technology, Modern Foreign Languages, Science, Mathematics, 
      Art and Design, Photography, Psychology, Food Technology, Health and Social 
      Care and, of course, English Language.</p>
    <p>Dear Ali,</p>
    <p>I am fine and hope that you are the same. It is a pleasure to meet you, 
      even though our meeting is only a virtual one. I am impressed by your command 
      of the language and your breadth and enthusiasm in learning. Mr. Williams's 
      students have always brought the highest standards with them, and you, the 
      most recent whom I have met, do not disappoint.</p>
    <p> Apart from English Language, I am studying modern foreign languages, namely 
      French, Spanish and Italian, and Media Studies at Advanced Subsidiary level. 
      As evident from my choice of subjects, I am an enthusiastic linguist, and 
      have a deep interest in philology.</p>
    <p>My mother is Spanish and my father is English, and, at home, my parents 
      have educated me to speak both languages from an early age. Being bilingual 
      puts me at a great advantage in the competitive world of education and work, 
      and has taught me to appreciate the skill of effective and fluent communication. 
      It has also highlighted for me the value of language in an individual&#8217;s 
      culture. As I am now researching, as part of an assignment on the English 
      Language course, a person&#8217;s language, dialect or even accent can reveal 
      a great deal of their personal background and cultural heritage. Languages 
      are a vital tool in the process of learning and of living. It is thoughts 
      like these that are fuelling some important ideas for my story on the fictitious 
      space expedition to one of Jupiter&#8217;s Galilean moons, Europa.</p>
    <p>Do you know why they are called, &quot;Galilean,&quot; and why there are 
      only four? Also, do you know anything about conditions on this particular 
      moon?</p>
    <p> For example, I can create a multi-ethnic crew aboard the spacecraft. I 
      could then use my language skills to record the way in which the crew members 
      communicate with their loved ones back home on Earth in several different 
      languages, thus recognising and celebrating the wealth of the cultural heritage 
      aboard the spacecraft. One of the astronauts could make a video diary in 
      his or her native tongue expressing all their emotions in order to be sent 
      to Earth for family and friends to watch. This would support the STAR programme&#8217;s 
      multi-lingual activities, and highlight the importance of language in communication.</p>
    <p>Your focus on the crew is a crucial factor in creating an effective story. 
      The counterexample to your thesis can be found in any of Hollywood's newest 
      (i.e., last 20 years or so...) productions in which the human factor is 
      all but thrown out the window in favor of special effects - computerized 
      glitz comprising quickly paced sound bytes, brilliant flashes of light, 
      incoherent strings of images, and so on, that do little more than to cause 
      a general disorientation of the audience. (Maybe this Hollywood phenomenon 
      is really an &quot;artistic&quot; reflection of society's more general disorientation 
      anyway. Who knows...?)</p>
    <p> My father is a sales manager for a major telecommunications company in 
      London, namely City Of London Telecommunications (COLT). I have visited 
      his workplace on several occasions for brief work experience sessions, and 
      I am very much aware of the world&#8217;s dependence on technology and the 
      international race to obtain the latest forms of this. I would greatly appreciate 
      your advice in researching the way in which NASA makes use of the latest 
      modern technology to enhance space expeditions.</p>
    <p>Communication - the ability to communicate - is the single most vital tool 
      that any of us possess. Imagine the mathematical prodigy who can prove any 
      theorem, solve any problem, but cannot tell what he/she did. The now famous 
      Indian mathematician, Srinivasa Ramanujan, came close to being one such. 
      Ramanujan was born in Erode, a small village about 400 km southwest of Madras. 
      He grew up in extreme poverty. Having no books, He invented his own mathematical 
      language and symbols to develop number theorems of Mozartean proportions; 
      his work was later translated in more standard terminology by himself and 
      the British mathematician, Hardy. Thank God that the two of them came together!</p>
    <p>Everything is, ultimately, language. The proof of this statement lies in 
      the fact that one can learn any field well enough to pass college examinations 
      merely by studying the appropriate lexicons in the field. I know. I've done 
      it. The field I chose was astronomy. I had in my possession a little field 
      guide, a popular Time-Life book called, &quot;The Universe,&quot; written 
      strictly for the intelligent lay person, and a dictionary of aeronautics 
      and astronautics ( Philosophical Library - now out of print). Eventually, 
      I abandoned the other books in favor of the dictionary.</p>
    <p>On any given day, I set myself the task of choosing a word, pursuing its 
      various cross references, working out any-and-all pertinent equations, and 
      writing the results in a notebook. I did not write stories, as you are about 
      to do: I wrote short but [ and this was an important condition] coherent 
      essays. As they developed, the essays quickly exposed the gaps in my learning, 
      which only a further pursuit into the dictionary was able to fill. Several 
      year later, I met an astronomer - one of my co-workers at NASA, in fact 
      - who was also a lecturer at a local university. He convinced me to attempt 
      his newly written collection of exams for first year college astronomy. 
      I scored an average grade of 98/100!</p>
    <p>Thus, the power of the lexicon!</p>
    <p>Today, I collect dictionaries. I have - or intend to have - at least one 
      dictionary for every subject that I am aware of - including (most recently) 
      social work. Two new dictionaries of social work have just made their appearance 
      in our local bookstores and I hope soon to obtain copies for my library.</p>
    <p> The main part of my story will be set aboard a very specialised spacecraft, 
      so it is vital for me to have a good general understanding of the Information 
      and Communication Technology used by NASA in order to describe the quotidian 
      life of the astronauts accurately and effectively. Some investigation into 
      modern ICT and even some possible futuristic innovations in science and 
      technology will enable me to stress the importance of language in communication 
      throughout my story. To do this efficiently, it will be necessary for me 
      to incorporate specific ICT lexis into my story.</p>
    <p>I agree.</p>
    <p>My mother is a Business Spanish teacher, and I am conscious of the need 
      for the use of specific vocabulary that both of my parents&#8217; jobs require. 
      Based on my research into the philology of vocabulary from various subject 
      areas, such as scientific terminology based on Latin and Greek words, I 
      could even experiment with the invention of new words to describe technology 
      innovations of the future. I trust that through conversing with you, Joe, 
      an expert in spacecraft-environment interactions, I will be able to gather 
      and share plenty of highly relevant material for my story.</p>
    <p>I had another co-worker (now retired) whose wife was on the etymological 
      staff for the Merriam Webster Dictionary. He made it his regular mission 
      to collect new terms for her to include in her files. I will certainly do 
      my best to help you in this regard.</p>
    <p> I would like to take time now to say that I feel honoured to have this 
      wonderful opportunity of participating in such a unique educational learning 
      programme. I am intrigued by the theme of outer space exploration, and motivated 
      by the possibility of working with a NASA scientist and the chance of becoming 
      a published author. </p>
    <p>Remember that the term, &quot;NASA scientist,&quot; is only a title, and 
      that titles and an appropriate number of pence will by you a cup of coffee. 
      I am, first and foremost, a human being, husband, father, and grandfather 
      who enjoys picking things apart to see what makes them tick and then sharing 
      the results with whomever will listen; a person who has also had the immense 
      good fortune of discovering how to make a decent living doing just that 
      - what he most enjoys!</p>
    <p> From what I have heard from my teacher, you, Joe, are evidently a highly 
      enthusiastic and educated NASA scientist, specialising in Mars, and I am 
      fully confident that you will prove to be an invaluable educational source, 
      and possible friend, throughout the course of this project.</p>
    <p>I hope, friend! And yes, I have some acquaintance with Mars.</p>
    <p>I thank you in advance for any help you may be able to offer me whilst 
      working on the STAR programme, and I promise to input one hundred percent 
      commitment and interest.</p>
    <p>I look forward to communicating with you again soon.</p>
    <p>Likewise,</p>

    <p> At 12:57 PM 11/1/2005 +0000, you (L.C Williams) wrote:</p>
    <p>Dear Joe,</p>
    <p>This is a paragraph omitted from Ali's original letter.</p>
    <p>From Ali:</p>
    <p>On another occasion, I would very much enjoy discussing with you the philosophical 
      and religious implications of finding life on another planet. I know that 
      languages and media are subject areas that I can research and feed directly 
      into my work on the STAR project. However, I realise that any religious 
      discussion between us will have to be limited to the classroom at Holy Cross, 
      as it would be unprofessional for a NASA scientist to infuse their religious 
      views with discussions about space. Nonetheless, Mr. Williams has informed 
      me that you are a Catholic, as I am, and therefore I consider you a valuable 
      source of ideas, and a highly appropriate discussion partner. I will give 
      this topic a great deal of thought and endeavour to establish my arguments 
      for and against it, although I am aware even at such an early stage that 
      this is a very sensitive issue where many different view points can be gathered.

      TO: Lawrence Williams <br>
      SUBJECT: Re: Religious aspects </p>
    <p>Ali,</p>
    <p>I am most excited to openly discuss these things with you. <br>
      Let's have at it!</p>
    <p>Joe Kolecki</p>
    <p>Dear Joe, </p>
    <p>Thank you very much for your encouraging reply! Your practical help and 
      moral support have increased my confidence in the STAR project and have 
      provided me with some innovative and exciting ideas for my work. Thank you 
      in particular for the personal anecdotes you shared with me regarding communication 
      and language, I can include these in my story, as they are highly relevant 
      examples of the themes I wish to address and highlight the importance of 
      language and communication in daily life. Your personal experiences are 
      humorous, entertaining, interesting, engaging and authentic material with 
      I value very much. Your collection of dictionaries also intrigues me. Personal 
      hobbies and artefacts are indicators of an individual&#8217;s personality, 
      background and culture. This is yet another idea which I can incorporate 
      into my story. </p>
    <p>As I explained in my last letter, the main part of my story will be set 
      aboard a specialised spacecraft. I would be really grateful if you could 
      give me a few pointers to help me start effective research into this area, 
      as it is vital that my story is scientifically accurate and that I produce 
      a credible account of a modern space expedition. For example, are there 
      any similar artificial satellites or spacecraft that have already been sent 
      to space on missions resembling the one I will describe in my story which 
      I could research? What are the main areas that I need to explore before 
      I endeavour to design my own spacecraft? I would welcome your guidance. 
    </p>
    <p>I have carried out some preliminary research into this subject. I know 
      that Jupiter has sixty moons, including the four Galilean satellites Io, 
      Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. I know that the Galileo spacecraft explored 
      the moons for eight years whilst orbiting Jupiter, from 1996 to 2003. This 
      is a recent space expedition that may be well worth researching in order 
      to gather information for my story. </p>
    <p>In response to your questions from your last e-mail, I believe these moons 
      are called &#8216;Galilean&#8217; as they were discovered by Marius Galileo 
      (Europa was discovered by him in the year 1610). With regards to the conditions 
      on Europa, I know that it has a very thin oxygen atmosphere and a smooth 
      shell of frozen water covering its surface; both conditions being friendly 
      to life. I have also found out that if you are navigating with a compass, 
      you should remember that Europa&#8217;s magnetic field changes periodically 
      as the planet passes through Jupiter&#8217;s own magnetic field. This variation 
      suggests that there could be a large amount of material beneath Europa&#8217;s 
      surface that conducts electricity. Could this be a large ocean of salty 
      water? Perhaps, after some deeper investigation, the response to this question 
      could be the answer to the &#8216;what if&#8217; question in my story? In 
      any case, I will have to decide this once I feel that I have gathered enough 
      firm evidence to prove this theory. If not, as I am still in the early stages 
      of developing my story, I may find another more appropriate hypothesis to 
      incorporate into my account. I would be more than happy to discuss this 
      with you at a later date. </p>
    <p>I look forward to hearing from you again, and hope that things will continue 
      to run smoothly for you and the rest of the team. Again, I thank you for 
      all your highly positive and encouraging comments. </p>
    <p>God bless! </p>

      SUBJECT: Re: Ali's story, again! </p>
    <p>Hi Ali and Lawrence, </p>
    <p>Great story! In the style of A.C. Clark and others whom I admire! I have 
      attached a copy with comments and notes! </p>
    <p>Many thanks, </p>
    <p>Joe Kolecki</p>
    <p>Hi again,</p>
    <p>I wanted to comment some more that Ali's story strikes a perfect balance 
      between the extraordinary and the mundane.</p>
    <p>Her person-to-person interactions are so very recognizable as typical day-to-day 
      people-interactions whose immediate familiarity provides both a good story 
      and its foundation. After all, people are what we are all about. And, in 
      the final analysis, people are what Ali's story is about. Bravo!</p>
    <p>Her treatment of the science is excellent for providing a very exotic stage 
      upon which her characters interact. In this setting, they are enabled to 
      reveal something of themselves in a unique way. Enough is actually said 
      so that, by inference, the attentive reader may deduce [or speculate about] 
      a great deal more. Wells was a master at this sort of device. So was Beethoven 
      (to jump tracks from literature into music). Beethoven once said that it 
      is better to leave the audience wanting more than to saturate them to the 
      point of fatigue. (My paraphrase...) Ali's story strikes this balance very 
      nicely.</p>
    <p>And finally, THANK YOU, Ali, for bringing the curtain down before landing 
      on Europa. The story is compact and comprises an artistic whole just the 
      way it is. Nothing lacking, nothing overdone. To have said anything more 
      would have been to burst the bubble. The story teller, and the musician 
      or artist, must blow and maintain a bubble of illusion for her/his audience, 
      balancing elements of reality and non-reality (e.g., in music, the impressionism 
      of C. Debussy - cf., especially works like Clouds). Ali's story had plenty 
      enough fiction, what with the future voyage, its objective, and the characters. 
      What an absolute relief [for me] to have Europa left alone to remain a mystery 
      before, throughout, and after the telling of the tale! Again, bravo! In 
      this regard, you have done A.C. Clark one better, I think! I, for one, LOVE 
      mystery!</p>
    <p>Postscript: I also appreciate Ali's cameo appearance in her story as Leon 
      Lear. Sagan did something similar when he appeared as Eli Arroway in his 
      novel, Contact. (Only Sagan's was not a cameo appearance; Eli was his main 
      character.)</p>
    <p>Again, nice work!!!</p>
