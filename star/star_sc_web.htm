    <p><strong>Background</strong><br>
      The Holy Cross School is a Catholic High School, formerly called Holy Cross 
      Convent School. As part of the STAR Project, we were involved in discussions 
      with Joe Kolecki, NASA Pathfinder scientist, on many levels. </p>
    <p>Dear Joe, </p>
    <p>My new class, currently six boys and six girls, have read &quot;A Once 
      and Noble Race&quot; and have also looked at some of the STAR web materials. 
      Thanks for providing the literary stimulus, as well as the scientific information! 
    </p>
    <p>We have just had an interesting discussion about the question you set us: 
      Why go to Europa? The need for mankind to explore the environment and set 
      challenges (like mountaineers, explorers, and even sportsmen and women) 
      figured large in the discussion. We need to find out more about what is 
      enticing about Europa and Jupiter, and provide a scientific as well as a 
      more general set of reasons. That will form part of today's lesson. I argued 
      that planet-hopping to avoid an expanding sun was probably a rather premature 
      reason, and by some time scale.... Nonetheless, they are starting to think 
      about issues. </p>
    <p>One student is studying AS Level Photography, and will, I hope, contribute 
      some ideas on the space applications of this to the group. We plan to add 
      ideas from their other subject interests (e.g. Food Technology, Modern Languages 
      (for the multinational astronauts, perhaps, to create video-diaries in different 
      languages), Mathematics (to calculate some of the distances, times of communication 
      etc.), Psychology (for how to form a team that could work together reliably 
      for years, and far from home). It could blossom: that is my hope. </p>
    <p>I shall keep you posted about progress. </p>
    <p>Warmest regards, </p>
    <p>Lawrence </p>
    <p>Michael then writes:</p>
    <p>Dear Joe,</p>
    <p>I am one of the students participating in the STAR project with Mr Williams. 
      I have collected various data needed to calculate a time-scale for the journey 
      to Europa. I am unsure, however, if the statistics I have gathered are correct 
      and it would be a great asset if you could point me in the right direction 
      with this investigation.</p>
    <p>Fastest recorded space craft speed<br>
      NASA-German Helios 1+2 reached speeds of 252, 800 km/h</p>
    <p>Relative distance from Earth to Europa = 800,000,000km<br>
      Fluctuation upon the orbits of Earth and Europa </p>
    <p>Therefore 800,000,000 / 252,800 calculates at 3,165 hours from Earth to 
      Europa.</p>
    <p>Therefore it should at this speed take 132 days to reach Europa.</p>
    <p>I am however slightly sceptical of this speed, and wondered if you could 
      perhaps reply with more accurate data which would be needed for this investigation. 
      Surely, it cannot take a shorter time to reach Europa than the time calculated 
      by Holy Cross to reach Mars!</p>
    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
    <p>Michael Nightingale (Mike)<br>
      Richard Challoner 6th Form Consortium</p>
    <p>Joe replies:</p>
    <p>Hi Mike,</p>
    <p>I was involved in the Pathfinder mission to Mars. I know that the Pathfinder 
      spacecraft left earth at about 120,000 km per hour and reached Mars at about 
      88,000 km per hour. The Pathfinder voyage required 7 months or 210 days, 
      approximately. And, while the distance from earth to Mars would be about 
      64 million km when the spacecraft arrived, the actual travel distance was 
      more like 496 million km. The orbit was not a straight line, you see; it 
      made use of the sun's gravity so that the spacecraft made an essentially 
      comet-like (elliptical) orbit around the sun and met up with Mars on the 
      other side from which it had been launched. I will give more details of 
      this scenario if you would like.</p>
    <p>We would do something similar with a mission to Jupiter. To thrust the 
      entire way would be prohibitively expensive. And, unless we were sending 
      humans, thrusting would be unnecessary. So, we would use the sun and establish 
      an elliptical orbit that would allow the spacecraft to coast from the earth 
      to Jupiter. We might do some fancy manoeuvring in the inner solar system 
      first, however, to use the gravity of Venus and Earth to gain more speed. 
      But the final result would be a coast to Jupiter all the same.</p>
    <p>You might want to check out the Galileo mission to Jupiter. Here is a website: 
      http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ . Galileo took 14 years to get from earth 
      to Jupiter. You might also want to check out the Cassini mission to Saturn. 
      See http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/overview/mission.cfm . The Cassini mission, 
      took only about 7 years to get to Saturn from earth. Perhaps this is the 
      model for your story. Since Saturn is about twice as far from the sun as 
      Jupiter, you might reasonably guess that it would take somewhere between 
      3 and 4 years (that is, 1100 - 1500 days) to get to Jupiter with late 20th 
      century, &quot;Cassini-type&quot; technology. Obviously, there is variability 
      in the numbers! Please read these sites carefully, as you will learn a great 
      deal that will prove helpful to you.</p>
    <p>Going on, once orbital insertion at Jupiter has been accomplished, additional 
      orbital manoeuvring to get to Europa would follow. Each orbit-insert (the 
      initial one around Jupiter and the second one around Europa) would require 
      giving up spacecraft energy. This energy would have to be regained before 
      the spacecraft could ever return home to earth. The energy would come, of 
      course, from burning spacecraft fuel, whether that fuel were brought from 
      earth (a very costly and inefficient proposition) or extracted from the 
      raw gases of Jupiter's upper atmosphere (a much more effective scenario 
      all the way around).</p>
    <p>You must also remember that the outward-bound spacecraft, in travelling 
      from the earth to Jupiter must be given an initial boost in total energy 
      (done by on-orbit thrusting while still at earth) and, once on its way, 
      would continuously loose energy as it climbed toward Jupiter. Just as a 
      ball slows down when thrown upward, the spacecraft will also slow down since 
      it is moving &quot;upward&quot; through the solar system (i.e., from Earth 
      to Jupiter).</p>
    <p>Your math is correct, considering that time is distance divided by speed. 
      But the speed, in this case, is constantly diminishing. Your calculation 
      assumes that it remains constant, which it could only do under conditions 
      of continuous thrusting. And even then, your estimated time would be too 
      short as it is doubtful that the spacecraft would travel in a straight line.</p>
    <p>Hope this helps!</p>
    <p>Best wishes on your STAR adventure!!!!!</p>
    <p>Your friend and colleague at NASA,</p>
    <p>Joe Kolecki </p>
