    <p><strong>AS Level teaching materials</strong><br>
      The Holy Cross School is a Catholic High School, formerly called Holy Cross 
      Convent School. As part of the STAR Project, we were involved in discussions 
      with Joe Kolecki, NASA Pathfinder scientist, on many levels. </p>
    <p>Part of this discussion involved more personal remarks about religion, 
      as Joe is a Catholic, as well as a scientist (and an organist, and a composer, 
      and an improviser, and an on-line teacher, and a friend.) </p>
    <p>The following dialogue between the various participants cannot be posted 
      on the NASA STAR web site itself, as it involves religious comments, and 
      as a US government employee, Joe cannot comment directly on religion. However, 
      as an American Christian emailing with UK Christian students, it is certainly 
      appropriate for MirandaNet to carry this discussion.</p>
    <p>Below, we show part of the email dialogue between my AS Level English class, 
      and Joe. They show clearly a Catholic view of space science, and that science 
      and religion are in no way as heavily &#8220;at odds&#8221; as some people 
      seem to think.</p>
    <p><strong>Explanation of the emails</strong><br>
      I, Lawrence Williams, as the Quaker teacher of the Catholic AS level English 
      Language group, sent Joe an email written by Jack, a student from Richard 
      Challoner School, our partner school at AS and A2 Levels, and Joe replied, 
      as you can see below, in great detail.</p>
    <p>Ruth Petersen, NASA education co-ordinator and also a Christian, asked 
      to be &#8220;kept in the loop&#8221;, hence her reference. Again, it is 
      important to note that she is commenting here to me, as a friend, not as 
      a NASA employee.</p>
    <p>This is therefore a four-way dialogue: <br>
      o Joe first, in <span class="blue">blue</span><br>
      o Ruth&#8217;s remark to me, then<br>
      o Part of my initial email, then <br>
      o the rest of Joe&#8217;s detailed reply, with the Christmas carol verses 
      interspersed <br>
      o Jack signing off</p>
    <p>The final section of main discussion is about a Christmas carol written 
      by Sydney Carter, a Quaker song-writer, that we studied in class, as I thought 
      might present a challenge to the students. </p>
    <p>These notes formed part of the next English lessons with my group, and 
      fed directly into the stories the students wrote for their AS Level English 
      Coursework.</p>
    <p>LW 9.01.06</p>
    <p><strong>The email discussion:</strong></p>
    <p class="blue">Hi Jack,</p>
    <p class="blue">I have taken quite a bit of leave during the holidays. We have 
      three grandchildren and two more on the way. But I am finally back in the 
      saddle, and looking forward to taking up this discussion! I have interlined 
      some comments in your original text.</p>

      Dear Lawrence</p>
    <p>That is a discussion I would love to hear. Your student has some very interesting

      Dear Joe,</p>
    <p>I am appending below another aspect of STAR that we have discussed briefly 
      in class. I think you will enjoy engaging in this....</p>
    <p>Jack writes:</p>
    <p>I am a student at the Holy Cross sixth form college, and have been given 
      the task in our English lessons of contemplating the religious and philosophical 
      implications of travelling into space to discover intelligent life.</p>
    <p>Nearly all earth religions that I have looked at are based around Earth 
      being the only planet to house intelligent life. In particular, Christianity, 
      as Christians believe that Jesus came to Earth and died so that our sins 
      could be forgiven. The story of Creation adds weight to this argument, as 
      it does not describe God creating life on any other planets. This raises 
      some serious questions:</p>
    <p>If there are other forms of intelligent life in the universe then surely 
      Jesus would have to visit them also, so that their sins could be forgiven?.</p>
    <p class="blue">I don't know. Let's try a reverse approach. Jesus came to die 
      for people only. I mean that He did not also die for whales, for example, 
      or spiders or any of the higher primates, all of which also comprise intelligent 
      species on earth.</p>
    <p class="blue">Intelligence is relative; i.e., we must always use an adjective 
      to specify the particular intelligence to which we are referring: human 
      intelligence, versus whale intelligence, versus spider intelligence, versus 
      higher primate intelligence, etc. Apparently, intelligence cannot be absolutely 
      defined (ask anyone in the AI community!). And yet, almost always, we implicitly 
      tend to think of intelligence only in terms of human intelligence i.e., 
      ourselves.</p>
    <p class="blue">Let&#8217;s substitute the term free will for the term intelligence. 
      There are only two types of free will (apart from God Who is absolutely 
      free) identified by theologians: angelic and human. We are not aware that 
      free will exists in any other species on earth (or in heaven); although, 
      to be fair, we are also not aware that it does not.</p>
    <p class="blue">At any rate, let&#8217;s use free will in place of intelligence 
      and see where it leads.</p>
    <p class="blue">Free will implies choice, and choice implies the possibility 
      of sin (the whole choice being to sin or to not-sin). Sin is what salvation 
      is all about. And Jesus came to bring salvation to people.</p>
    <p class="blue">Sin is of two broad types: human and angelic.</p>
    <p class="blue">Before the foundation of the world, God established all of 
      the laws by which all things are to abide. In human terms, each law carries 
      within itself a statement of &quot;action&quot; and &quot;reaction&quot;: 
      i.e., an antecedent and a consequent.</p>
    <p class="blue">Apply fire to an object and it will become hot.</p>
    <p class="blue">Hit a man in the nose and you&#8217;d better duck!</p>
    <p class="blue">All things everywhere are absolutely bound by God&#8217;s laws. 
      Nothing is exempt. The justice of God is made manifest exactly in that there 
      are no exemptions. All things are given an equal footing.</p>
    <p class="blue">In terms of a response to God&#8217;s law, angels and humans 
      are given a very special freedom of choice free will so that whatever consequences 
      they shall eternally endure are not dictated at all by God by determined 
      by themselves i.e., by their chosen actions.</p>
    <p class="blue">Now, apart from free will, sin is not possible. If animals 
      (and, by extension, plants) do not have free will, then animal and plant 
      sin is not possible. Therefore, such creatures as whales (and so on) are 
      not in need of any sort of salvation. This same argument might apply to 
      extraterrestrials.</p>
    <p class="blue">The free choice given to angels and to humans is whether to 
      submit completely to God&#8217;s holy will and thus to permit Him to make 
      His will their will, or to draw back from submission and to strike off in 
      another (nonexistent) direction of their own choosing (which other direction 
      is purely illusory a trick of the devil a liar and the father of lies).</p>
    <p class="blue">Remember Mary&#8217;s fiat: &#8220;Be it done unto me according 
      to Thy will.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="blue">And the Lord&#8217;s prayer: &#8220; Thy will be done&#8230;&#8221;</p>
    <p class="blue">Submission to His will is God's only and supreme desire for 
      us. Submission affirms that we wish God to utterly and completely possess 
      us and to make of us everything that He desires for us to be from before 
      the foundation of the world.</p>
    <p class="blue">N.B.: In becoming slaves to God, so to speak, we become absolutely 
      free to be everything we were originally created to be no holds barred!</p>
    <p class="blue">Non-submission affirms that we wish to follow some other (non-existent) 
      path, and so not to become slaves of God. Since non-submission is the negation 
      of submission, it follows that in non-submission we shall become nothing 
      that God intended from the beginning.</p>
    <p class="blue">N.B.: In denying holy slavery to God, we actually loose every 
      last vestige of our freedom to be everything that we were created to be. 
      Nothing is left!</p>
    <p class="blue">And there are no other alternatives!</p>
    <p class="blue">So we now ask: what is it, exactly, that God intends for us 
      from before the foundation of the world? God intends for each of us to be 
      something (opposed to nothing); i.e., to bear forth some attribute of His 
      ineffable Being, the Name and Essence of which is I AM, the Name spoken 
      to Moses.</p>
    <p class="blue">In bearing forth some attribute of His Being, we reflect the 
      glory of God within ourselves and render to Him perfect praise.</p>
    <p class="blue">God created us from nothing (ex nihilo ). Nothing was the raw 
      material God used in making us! If we reject the something that God intended, 
      then we must settle for the only possible alternative: i.e., the nothing 
      that we originally were. And to do so is death.</p>
    <p class="blue">Hence scripture tells us that the consequence of sin is death.</p>
    <p class="blue">Note that death is very different from un-creation : God does 
      not uncreate ; once having created anything, that creation endures for eternity. 
      The love of God precludes uncreation .</p>
    <p class="blue">Death is a reversion from whatever we are now to the nothingness 
      from which we were created rather than a conversion from our former sinful 
      self into the image and likeness of Jesus Christ. This reversion, far from 
      uncreation, involves an eternal awareness of what we might have been but 
      ultimately rejected . Pure hell!!!</p>
    <p class="blue">Earlier, I suggested that sin is what salvation is all about. 
      Let&#8217;s consider sin in angels and humans.</p>
    <p class="blue">Angels were created outside of time and space. Angels are spiritual: 
      their only single spacetime limitation is a temporal one: all angels had 
      a beginning. Beyond that, they are spaceless and timeless.</p>
    <p class="blue">We say that the angels are aveternal or sempiternal.</p>
    <p class="blue">This might seem a big nut to swallow, so let&#8217;s break 
      it down. Spiritual realities are non-corporeal (nonmaterial) and, therefore, 
      timeless and spaceless (since time and space pertain only to matter cf., 
      general relativity or your favorite theologian!).</p>
    <p class="blue">Spirit is manifest whenever and wherever it acts.</p>
    <p class="blue">Truth is spiritual. Truth has no material substance or form, 
      no molecular formula. Truth can act in as many or as few places and times 
      in which it is being practiced. Truth does not change with time or location, 
      truth cannot be divided or multiplied (hence it is called simple - Aristotle, 
      Aquinas).</p>
    <p class="blue">Ditto for love, justice, hope, etc.</p>
    <p class="blue">The sin of the fallen angels pure spirits - was accomplished 
      outside of space and time. Each angel made its own choice. Angels do not 
      procreate as humans do. Thus, there are no generations of angels as there 
      are generations of people. Each angel is a &#8220;species&#8221; unto itself.</p>
    <p class="blue">Once the fallen angels sinned, everything was over for them. 
      There were no future generations to save. The fallen angels had chosen once 
      and for all, each angel each angel species - for itself.</p>
    <p class="blue">And down they went. &#8220;The dragon dragged a third of the 
      stars from the heavens with its tail.&#8221; (Book of Revelation.)</p>
    <p class="blue">When Adam sinned, on the other hand, he did so in space and 
      time. All of the rest of humanity (including you and me) was still future 
      : &#8220;in his loins.&#8221; Thus, Adam made a choice that damned not only 
      himself but the entire future human race in every land and on every continent 
      countless unborn generations yet to come .</p>
    <p class="blue">This hardly seems fair! If humanity were to be given the same 
      chance as the angels, then each individual human being should be given the 
      opportunity of applying his/her free will for him/her-self. I for one certainly 
      don&#8217;t want the consequences of Adam&#8217;s choice on my back!!!</p>
    <p class="blue">Materiality complicates the &#8220;individuality thing&#8221; 
      spoken of for angels in that, while physically we are many individuals, 
      able to procreate offspring, we are still only one race one species - the 
      human race Homo sapiens-sapiens . Thus, in the action of only one man, the 
      entire race went down!</p>
    <p class="blue">But God in His Mercy had already made perfect provision for 
      the rest of us: He took upon Himself the full consequences of Adam&#8217;s 
      sin (and everybody else&#8217;s too) and reopened the possibility of heaven 
      for each and every individual.</p>
    <p class="blue">In one man, humanity sinned. In that same man hung all the 
      future of the race. Therefore all of humanity must endure the consequences. 
      It was as though Adam had lost his God-likeness through sin, and so no longer 
      had it to pass on to his offspring.</p>
    <p>If, in one man (Adam), the entire race fell, then in another 
      man (Jesus) every individual was restored to grace.</p>
    <p class="blue">Finite creation had offended an infinite God; therefore, an 
      infinite debt now existed which a finite humanity could never pay back. 
      A pretty bitter conundrum to be sure!</p>
    <p class="blue">Solution: Infinite God Himself became man and, sinless, bore 
      our sins and endured the just death which is their due.</p>
    <p class="blue">Jesus Christ was incarnate in time and space; He lived and 
      died in time and space; and He rose from the dead in time and space, the 
      promise of our own future resurrection.</p>
    <p class="blue">An infinite debt was now completely satisfied by a Sacrifice 
      of infinite merit. The just requirements of the law were fulfilled and grace 
      flooded in. Now each person was is - free to choose for him/her-self between 
      life and death.</p>
    <p class="blue">In this present age of grace, each person who accepts and receives 
      Jesus Christ in baptism is renewed in spirit, even though each must still 
      await the renewal of the body. This renewal will only occur at the resurrection 
      from the dead at the end of time when all things are made new.</p>
    <p class="blue">This rather long argument demonstrates (I hope) the deeply 
      human nature of sin and salvation. Whether other species elsewhere on earth 
      or in space - might be similarly affected, God alone knows: but I believe 
      not.</p>
    <p class="blue">If we were to find intelligent life on some distant planet, 
      and they had never heard of God or Jesus, or any other world religion, how 
      would this affect religion on Earth?</p>
    <p class="blue">As before, it would depend on the nature of that intelligence. 
      Since you specifically ask about religion , permit me to argue that religion 
      per se is purely a human phenomenon.</p>
    <p class="blue">Consider an analogy: I have a set of tuned bells. Each bell 
      rings when struck, but each bell produces a different tone from all the 
      others. Let&#8217;s say that one particular bell, which resonates at, say, 
      middle-C, represents humanity. Let the note it produces, middle-C, stand 
      for that particular response to God and His creation that we humans call 
      religion .</p>
    <p class="blue">Since all the other bells produce tones other than middle-C, 
      we may argue that they must represent something other than humanity, and 
      their resonant frequencies, something other than religion. If another bell 
      were to exist that produced middle-C, we would have to argue that its identity 
      with the humanity bell must also make it a humanity bell.</p>
    <p class="blue">In this analogy, religion is a purely human phenomenon.</p>
    <p class="blue">Our &#8220;middle-C&#8221; response is not particularly conditioned 
      by the fact, say, that humpback whales have recently been discovered to 
      be able to communicate their songs over vast stretches of the ocean floor. 
      Whale songs are considered by many to be a kind of language, and therefore 
      indicative of some sort of non-human intelligence.</p>
    <p class="blue">If our religion is not deeply impacted by a deepening awareness 
      of whale intelligence on earth, then it is probable that it will not be 
      deeply impacted by being made aware of extraterrestrial intelligence. Only 
      if that extraterrestrial intelligence turned out to be human (another middle-C 
      bell) would religion be impacted; otherwise, I believe that religion would 
      continue to go along pretty well as it always has.</p>
    <p>Mr Williams did show us a Christmas carol in one of our lessons that somewhat 
      encapsulates a very positive view of all religions, as well as any that 
      may exist on any other planets.</p>
    <p>And here it is:</p>
    <p>A Carol of the Universe<br>
      Sydney Carter</p>
    <p>Every star shall sing a carol;<br>
      Every creature, high or low,<br>
      Come and praise the King of Heaven,<br>
      By whatever name you know.</p>
    <p class="blue">Book of Job: And the angels shouted with joy at the dawn of 
      creation.</p>
    <p>When the King of all creation<br>
      Had a cradle on the Earth,<br>
      Holy was the human body,<br>
      Holy was the human birth:</p>
    <p class="blue">Remember that Jesus was both human and divine. His divinity 
      came from His being begotten of the Father in eternity, His body, from being 
      born of the virgin in time. Jesus is often referred to as the God-man or 
      man-God for this reason.</p>
    <p>Who can tell what other cradle<br>
      High above the Milky Way<br>
      Still may rock the King of Heaven<br>
      On another Christmas day?</p>
    <p class="blue">Every living heart holds the Word of God within itself. Remember, 
      the Father created all things through the Word Who is identified as the 
      Son of God and Son of Man, Jesus Christ. Wherever there is life, that life 
      must be a cradle which either holds Him or rejects Him not necessarily in 
      His humanity only, but in His humanity and divinity combined as one.</p>
    <p>Who can count how many crosses<br>
      Still to come or long ago<br>
      Crucify the King of Heaven?<br>
      Holy is the name I know:</p>
    <p class="blue">I do not know that this verse is justified. I cite the long 
      argument I gave above.</p>
    <p>Who can tell what other body<br>
      He will hallow for his own?<br>
      I will praise the son of Mary<br>
      Brother of my blood and bone.</p>
    <p class="blue">Scripture has it that Jesus died once for all (Pauline epistles). 
      I wonder if this is to be interpreted in terms of earth only, or in terms 
      of all the universe?</p>
    <p>Every star and every planet,<br>
      Every creature high and low,<br>
      Come and praise the King of Heaven<br>
      By whatever name you know</p>
    <p class="blue">This lovely verse reminds me of the heavenly praise described 
      in the Book of Revelation (Apocalypse).</p>
    <p>I look forward to your response after the Christmas holidays.</p>
    <p class="blue">Thank you. I look forward to your response back!!!</p>
    <p class="blue">Merry Christmas (belatedly) and a happy and blessed new year!</p>
