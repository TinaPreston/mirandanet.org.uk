  <h3>An international, cross-curricular exploration of Space Science, through 
    on-line learning tools</h3>
  <p><strong>STAR has global lift-off</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <div class="content"> <em>&#8220;But, you&#8217;re a scientist, so you MUST 
      know!&#8221;</em></div>
    <div class="content"><em>&#8220;No. I am scientist, because I DON&#8217;T 
      know. But I do know how to find things out.&#8221;</em></div>
  </blockquote>
  <p>These words, by Joe Kolecki, NASA Mars Pathfinder scientist, form the basis 
    of the scientific thinking behind the latest ICT project being developed at 
    the Holy Cross School, in partnership with the <a href="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/">NASA 
    Glenn Learning Technologies Project</a> (LTP), Cleveland, Ohio:</p>
  <p><strong>STAR - Science Through ARts</strong> </p>
  <p>Yes, there is a capital R in ARts: it ensures that you can find us very easily 
    through Google. </p>
  <p>STAR is an exciting, new, multi-disciplinary, multi-lingual, science-based 
    ICT project. It has been designed to increase students&#8217; enthusiasm for 
    &#8220;Real World&#8221; science, by using NASA on-line materials as the stimulus 
    for creative activities across the whole secondary school curriculum. Mars 
    exploration was chosen as the topic.</p>
  <p>The pilot project, which ran from September 2002 to May 2003, included junior 
    and secondary schools: Mound Elementary, Ohio; Southfield, Michigan; Octorara, 
    Pennsylvania; Holy Cross, London; and Ikeda, Osaka. </p>
  <p>The students, over 200 in all, used NASA web materials and virtual mentors 
    as a source of science information, word processing to assemble their research, 
    and PowerPoint, desktop publishing, music software, email, email attachments, 
    and videoconferencing equipment, to develop their creative narrative, musical, 
    and artistic skills. </p>
  <p>Joe Kolecki, NASA Mars Pathfinder scientist, provided the professional scientific 
    teaching, through videoconferences with all of the schools involved; by direct 
    email to some of the students and their teachers; and through the detailed 
    annotation of Word documents, and PowerPoint files, exchanged across &#8220;The 
    Pond&#8221; as email attachments. </p>
  <p>Ruth Petersen (LTP) developed the content of the STAR web site, and co-ordinated 
    and guided the work of the US schools, as well as the final presentations. 
    She commented, &#8220;Students today see little connection between the science 
    they learn in school and science in the real world. Through the horizontal 
    integration of science with the arts in the year-long STAR project, students 
    began to see the relevance of science to the world at large. The technologically-charged 
    learning experience allowed students to collaborate while being guided by 
    online mentors and their teachers as access providers, giving students the 
    opportunity to use technologies both in and outside of the classroom to complete 
    learning activities. Studies in U.S. schools show that students want more 
    input in deciding how learning will take place and how technology will play 
    a part. STAR allows that to happen. In most of the pilot schools, the students 
    were the drivers for participation in STAR. They were allowed flexibility 
    in the creation of their &#8216;stories&#8217; and demonstrated proficiency 
    in use of ICT tools to get the job done.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The pilot project culminated in a technical tour de force: an amazing global 
    exchange (live across three continents) of the scientific learning outcomes 
    by the students, in a final presentation session using combined ISDN and IP 
    video-conferencing, and web-casting. Joe Radke at Baylor University, Texas, 
    kindly provided vital, and brilliant, technical bridging support for this 
    aspect of the project.</p>
  <p>One of the Holy Cross Year 7 students, In-Sun Tribe, describes what she actually 
    did in her lessons:</p>
  <p>&#8226; ICT We searched the NASA web sites about Mars. We used PowerPoint 
    and Microsoft Word to create stories. We downloaded music, pictures, and data, 
    and linked pages together with the music. We learnt how to use Flaming Text, 
    clip art, email, video-conferencing, and animation. <br>
    &#8226; English We wrote scientific Mars stories. We improved our sentences, 
    and learnt some hot tips for our writing. We looked at sentence and story 
    endings, and the use of descriptive language. We also read a copy of Joe Kolecki&#8217;s 
    story, &#8220;The Once and Noble Race&#8221;, and studied his science notes 
    about it.<br>
    &#8226; Art We made landscape pictures of Mars in groups, and in different 
    ways, such as with pastels, paint, collage, and mosaic. We also discussed 
    the different textures of the surface of Mars.<br>
    &#8226; Science In Science, we checked the facts in our Mars stories, and 
    learned new facts about Mars and space. We used the Internet, science books, 
    and Joe Kolecki (live!) to find and check out the facts.<br>
    &#8226; Music We used music keyboards to make our own different tunes and 
    songs, to show things happening on Mars, and in space.<br>
    &#8226; Religious Education We debated whether people should go to Mars, and 
    if we found life there, would we bring it back? Also, if it were safe for 
    us to live on Mars, what religion would it become?</p>
  <p> The thing I liked doing best was the PowerPoint story, because it was fun 
    to download sounds and animations. I learnt a lot of new things, especially 
    in Science, English, and ICT. I am pleased with the final result, and I enjoyed 
    doing it very much.&#8221;</p>
  <p>One of the stories, &#8220;Mars, Lost and Found&#8221;, written by eleven-year-old 
    Katie Noon, is now proudly displayed on the NASA STAR web site, along with 
    full instructions on how other schools can become involved. </p>
  <p>The Ikeda Senior High School, Osaka (the Japanese &#8220;sister school&#8221; 
    to Holy Cross) contributed PowerPoint stories, both in English and in Japanese. 
    Head of Music at Ikeda, Ryuzo Tanaka-san was &#8220;moved to tears&#8221; 
    by the sharing of ideas across the world in this new way. &#8220;I am convinced 
    of the greatness of this project,&#8221; he said, &#8220; and the wonderful 
    international network of members.&#8221; </p>
  <p>Students at Holy Cross were given advice, &#8220;live&#8221; from their friends 
    in Japan by video-conference, on the sort of music which might be added to 
    their PowerPoint science fiction stories. &#8220;It was great fun working 
    on the music together with the Ikeda students,&#8221; said Lizzie Mason, Y7. 
  </p>
  <p>The American schools presented a range of scientific work, using word-processed 
    and PowerPoint documents, and Mike Terrell summed up the reaction in Michigan: 
    &#8220;We definitely want to continue our involvement with STAR in the future. 
    It&#8217;s a great way to learn science.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And there are wider issues, too. As Prof. Hiro Tanaka of Osaka Kyoiku University 
    remarked, &#8220; I do hope, with this special experience, the Ikeda students 
    will become a new type of scientist in the near future, and contribute to 
    the development of science, and to world peace, as well.&#8221; The Ikeda 
    students have also become aware of the importance of the bridge between Science 
    and Art.&#8221; And Ayako Amano and Erika Fujimura agreed. &#8220;This project 
    gave us a very special and rare experience, especially for one of our members, 
    because his dream changed. He wants to work at NASA in the future.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Endorsement of the project has come from The British Council, who kindly 
    published an article about STAR in their international &#8220;Science Education 
    Newsletter &#8220; edition 158, and from the Computer Based Learning in Science 
    group, who are publishing the background papers in the proceedings of their 
    Cyprus Conference (CBLIS 2003). BECTA, too, kindly decided to include STAR 
    in their June teachers&#8217; Newsletter. </p>
  <p>The STAR web site was launched in Europe, in April, at the international 
    Poskole Conference 2003 (Charles University, Prague) and will be launched 
    in the USA jointly by Ruth and myself, at the National Educational Computing 
    Conference (NECC 2003) in June / July.</p>
  <p>Why not join us? Have fun learning &#8220;Real World&#8221; Science, and 
    maybe see your students&#8217; best, creative, science-based work published 
    by NASA. </p>
