  <p>Christina Preston, the chair of MirandaNet, a fellowship of interested parties 
    in education which includes Microsoft, Toshiba. Promethean and the Institute 
    of Education, University of London, argues that ICT should be used much more 
    for giving young people a voice and breaking down cultural barriers.</p>
  <p> It&#8217;s a fallacy to think that children are not interested in politics 
    or are unaffected by major world events. I can remember as a child cowering 
    under the table when the 1962 Cuban missile crisis appeared on my parents&#8217; 
    television screen. War, conflict, poverty, homelessness and the environment 
    are just some issues that are important to many children, even those living 
    in comfortable Western societies. You don&#8217;t need me to tell you that 
    we are living through a turbulent period. September 11th, the Afghan War and 
    the conflict in Iraq have all made the world seem a less safe place, so what 
    impact must these be having on children, as they are bombarded with images 
    on their TV screens and on the front of newspapers? Children do not go around 
    this world with their eyes and ears closed. They know a lot more about what 
    is happening on a global basis than we often give them credit for. What is 
    true is they often find it difficult to articulate their thoughts and feelings, 
    especially on a face-to-face basis with an adult. </p>
  <p>What is also true is that despite living in an information age of 24-hour 
    news programmes, the internet and teletext, there is still a lot of ignorance 
    about other people&#8217;s cultures and there is a lack of understanding on 
    how others live. Let me give you an example. I have just returned from Syria 
    and I was very much taken by the fact that there are women with very good 
    jobs and that it&#8217;s a secular state. Now, Syria is also a presidential 
    dictatorship, which I don&#8217;t support, but I was still a surprised to 
    find how tolerant the Syrians were when it came to women&#8217;s rights and 
    religious freedom. </p>
  <p>Teachers are reporting increased tension both in the classroom and the playground 
    as a result of the current conflicts. There has been a rise in religious intolerance. 
    There has been an increase in bullying. There has been a growth of racism. 
    It&#8217;s a truism that much of the mistrust in our world is due to ignorance 
    and lack of understanding. It&#8217;s also a failure of people to consider 
    alternative points of view. That&#8217;s why I believe ICT can be a force 
    for good, because it makes it easier to communicate with others across both 
    time and distance.</p>
  <p>At present, a lot of ICT tends to be focused on the established curriculum 
    but I&#8217;m really interested in the new subject, citizenship, and using 
    ICT to develop our creative and thinking skills. It&#8217;s a very topical 
    issue, especially as citizenship has been a compulsory subject in the national 
    curriculum for over a year, yet Ofsted says teachers are not yet confident 
    in this area. Fortunately, I believe the pendulum is swinging back and there&#8217;s 
    a realisation that we need to do more in the area of citizenship.</p>
  <p>Of course, a number of schools have already forged links with overseas institutions 
    and that&#8217;s a good thing. But I&#8217;m more interested in people talking 
    to each other and discovering more about each other rather than simply working 
    together on curriculum-based projects. That is why MirandaNet has established 
    the World Ecitizens Fellowship. World Ecitizens is a non-profit making organisation 
    that aims to promote understanding of other cultures and customs, especially 
    amongst younger people. We now have twenty-five <em>WE</em> chapters in places 
    such as Africa, Australia, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Japan, the USA as well 
    as the UK.</p>
  <p>The projects involve communities working together towards conflict resolution. 
    Collaborations focus on joint activities like developing creativity, communication 
    life and thinking skills. To support these projects MirandaNet Fellows have 
    developed a web based learning environment. This website provides a place 
    where World Ecitizens can join together to envision a sense of a shared future; 
    create a sense of shared history; and capture and share learning experiences. 
    It is a safe learning space, which we see as a rich and exciting resource 
    for community exchange and international understanding. </p>
  <p>Since the <em>WE</em> environment was set-up last January, communities and 
    classes of young people have produced posters, video clips and comic strips 
    about citizenship issues of their choice such as homelessness and international 
    citizenship. Some young people have worked with artists and writers in residence. 
    In one project exploring homelessness, children from East London produced 
    a graphic novel and a video highlighting the issues they had researched. The 
    publishers of 2000AD worked with schools and homeless charities. Two freelance 
    cartoonists were involved and film makers from Kushti Moving Image. These 
    young artists were keen to lend their skills to help the children communicate 
    effectively, and they were impressed by the children&#8217;s professional 
    approach. </p>
  <p>The George Mitchell School in London examined a variety of citizenship themes 
    such as social exclusion and immigration. Holy Cross Convent School in Kingston 
    upon Thames has established collaborative Internet and video conferencing 
    links with the Ikeda Junior High School in Osaka, Japan, allowing them to 
    share each other&#8217;s culture through sound and video</p>
  <p>The World Ecitizens (<em>WE</em>) website started with UnITy, a project supported 
    by Domex and the DFES in which UK teachers and students collaborated within 
    schools, across the wider community and internationally to begin building 
    a knowledge base and communication hub with children from the UK, Portugal, 
    Ireland, Bangladesh and China. In these projects children are getting the 
    opportunity to think about how the world can be made a better place. </p>
  <p>It&#8217;s ironic that in today&#8217;s so-called global village, the world 
    seems more divided than ever. With ICT we have the opportunity to bridge cultural 
    and political divides; to help bring young people together to share thoughts, 
    ideas, hopes and aspirations. If we can help spread the message that all of 
    us are citizens of the same planet and that we all share a common humanity, 
    then many of the barriers that divide us can be broken down. What could be 
    a better use for ICT than this?</p>
