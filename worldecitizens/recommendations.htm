    for Actions: Suggestions from Experts</h3>
  <p>(These recommendations are availabe as a Word document in <a href="Recommendations_English.doc">English</a> and in
    <a href="Recommendations_Chinese.doc">Chinese</a>)</p>
  <p>We, the delegates from Australia, China, Denmark, Japan, Korea, Singapore,
    UK, USA, are gathered in Beijing for the 2nd International Forum on Citizenship
    Education for Children and Youths held from 22nd -24th October 2008. Throughout
    the forum we shared the innovative practices undertaken by the participating
    countries and discussed the current issues. During the forum, we reached
    a general consensus on citizenship education, that is a framework centered
    around developing qualities, attitudes, habits, capabilities, concepts and
    skills that prepare students on a path of continued personal growth and enabling
    them to be active protagonists in transforming society. The following recommendations
    are proposed to deal with the challenges in promoting citizenship education.</p>
  <p><strong> 1. Recommendation for School Principals</strong><br>
      The principals&#8217; endorsement of citizenship education has a positive
      influence on creating a united vision for the entire school. Therefore
      we should recommend that principals should be the first point of citizenship
    education as well as being engaged in its implementation.</p>
  <p><strong> 2. Recommendation for Teachers</strong><br>
      There is a need for ongoing teachers&#8217; professional development programmes,
        teachers&#8217; continuous plan-action-reflection cycle, teachers&#8217; sharing
        experiences with other teachers. Teachers should model the desired behaviour.
    Students learn best when the environment is joyful, loving and encouraging.</p>
  <p>They
          need to encourage critical thinking, allowing students to form their
          own opinions on issues by researching, giving students opportunities
          to work on projects in teams, discussing current issues and community
          challenges
          free of control and ridicule, and encouraging children to participate
    with less teacher lecturing. </p>
  <p><strong>3. Recommendation for Students</strong><br>
      Citizenship can be more effectively internalized when learners are
            expected to take an active part in experiential learning. Therefore,
            students
            are encouraged to debate the meaning of the citizenship and involve
    themselves in community volunteer work to share personal learning.</p>
  <p><strong>4.
          Recommendation for School Culture</strong><br>
      A successful citizenship education fosters a culture of character
              in the school, bringing out the best in every child, creating a
    caring environment, fit for joyful learning and striving for excellence.</p>
  <p><strong>5.
        Recommendation for Parents</strong><br>
      Parents play a critical role in bridging between learning at home
                and learning at school. Therefore, we recommend different approaches
                to
                be adopted to
                involve the parents effectively. New communication channels can
                be developed such as: establishing a Parent and Teacher Association
                of the School
                or Parent-Teacher and Parent-Teacher-Student association. One
        new channel of communication
                might be a web-based interactive newsletter sent to families
        monthly informing
                them of what has happened and will be happening in the school.
                Such
                a communication should include interesting short stories told
        by teachers about the children,
                advice about parenting and letters and articles from parents.    </p>
  <p><strong>6. Recommendation for Professional Institutes</strong><br>
      We recommend that the professional institutions consider the
                  relevance of action research methods that help to develop ownership
                  amongst
                  all the key
                  stakeholders. Small-scale qualitative and quantitative methods
                  can be employed in order to share the findings, to assess what
                  has been
                  learnt
                  and to create
                  new knowledge. The resulting case studies and reports can be
                  disseminated within an iterative process in which new knowledge
                  is created and
    new policy is developed collaboratively.</p>
  <p><strong>7. Recommendation for
          Community</strong><br>
      The community needs to learn to have love for and faith in
                    the youth, supporting them in their idealism, creating opportunities
                    for their
                    involvement in
                    community matters and welcoming them in doing acts of service
    for their community.</p>
  <p><strong>8. Recommendation for government and
        public</strong><br>
      The governments at different levels and the public at large
                      should create and maintain a supportive social environment
                      including
                      the public media
                      and websites, thus to ensure the healthy development of
    children and youth.</p>
  <p><strong> 9. International Exchange and Collaborations</strong><br>
      International exchange and cooperation, as illustrated
                        with the two forums, proves to be an effective mechanism
                        for sharing
                        lessons
                        and
                        expertise
                        among the participating countries. Our ongoing discussions
                        at this forum, followed
                        by plans of action will remain as the starting point
        of this collaboration. In addition, Chinese delegates can
                        be invited
                        to visit other countries,
                        to attend similar conferences when held overseas, as
        well as being exposed to
                        different models of citizenship education. Communication
                        between the international institutions and practitioners
                        should not
                        be limited to once every two
                        years at the forum. An ongoing dialogue need to be continued
                        in various forms.
                        The themes for the next forum might relate to the evaluation
                        and assessment
    of the impact of citizenship education projects.</p>
