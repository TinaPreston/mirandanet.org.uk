    <h2>Teachers’ and Trainers’ Perspectives</h2>
  <p><strong>Researching the outcomes of the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) ICT 
    Teacher Training</strong></p>
  <p><a href="index.htm">Full Report</a> | TES Article | <a href="interim.htm">Interim 
    Report</a> | <a href="background.htm">Background</a> | <a href="team.htm">Project 
    Team</a> </p>
  <p><em>(Original text of article published in the TES in February 04)</em></p>
    <p>80 per cent of the UK’s 450,000 teachers have now completed the New Opportunities 
      Fund’s (NOF) &pound;230 million programme on Information and Communications 
      Technology (ICT). Training, undertaken by forty seven Approved Training 
      Providers (ATPs), which began in 1999.</p>
  <p>The programme’s planners broke new ground in three ways: commercial companies 
    were invited to link with university education departments, local authorities, 
    independent advisors and teachers to provide training; the programme was to 
    cover classroom applications of ICT, not basic skills; and online learning 
    was emphasised, to introduce teachers to the National Grid for Learning (NGfL).</p>
  <p>Controversy began when the Times Education Supplement questioned the quality 
    of courses, and Ofsted began to question the learning outcomes. In fact, these 
    early warnings triggered substantial improvements.</p>
  <p>Because of the controversy surrounding this programme, the MirandaNet evaluation, 
    completed during 2002-2003, aimed to present a balanced report, reflecting 
    the multiple perspectives of teachers, teacher leaders, trainers, inspectors 
    and policy makers.</p>
  <p>A key issue was the significance of school culture and leaders’ attitudes 
    towards ICT. No progress could be made unless the professional vision was 
    agreed within the school, and positive action taken to embrace the programme, 
    including effective, whole school needs analysis.</p>
  <p>The choice of trainer and the working relationship with the school were also 
    central. Some schools and trainers had to work at this relationship; a few 
    parted company. Also key was the quality of training. Inspirational teaching 
    helped teachers to feel they had achieved significant learning, but some trainers, 
    particularly from business, were less well received. Face-to-face training 
    was essential for beginners and the less confident. Some experienced users 
    preferred self-paced learning using CD-ROMs or online support; Overall there 
    was little evidence of online learning and e-mentoring as the NGfL infrastructure 
    was not complete, and those web based learning environments that were used 
    were overloaded.</p>
  <p>Measuring achievement was difficult. Accreditation was neither required under 
    NOF regulations, nor popular among teachers. Trainers operating rigorous accreditation 
    lost out when teachers only completed four fifths of the course and accreditation 
    standards where they existed, varied considerably. </p>
  <p>Collegiality began to emerge later in the evaluation, reflecting newer thinking 
    about the building of learning communities and knowledge bases, and one form 
    of accreditation involved web-portfolios from which other teachers could learn. 
  </p>
  <p>The evaluation’s statistical survey questioned a full cross-section of 1,000 
    teachers. Three quarters of responses indicated successful learning, some 
    saying participation had been essential for individual growth and for school 
    development. Several found the training enjoyable, made progress and gained 
    new ICT knowledge. Well organised, well informed, flexible, personable and 
    supportive trainers were praised. Specialist training both in SEN and subject 
    disciplines, were valued, and classroom-based ICT projects stimulated fresh 
    ideas and approaches. Basic skills options, in-house partnerships with trainers, 
    and high quality resources were welcomed, and the impact of laptops, digital 
    cameras and interactive whiteboards was important. Increased collegiality 
    was mentioned, including the involvement of teaching assistants, supply teachers 
    and students.</p>
  <p>Criticism characterised one fifth of the responses. Teachers wanted more 
    about classroom management, greater flexibility in the programmes, with varied 
    teaching styles and differentiated learning, more ideas for lesson preparation, 
    time to explore new ideas, and more meeting and sharing with colleagues. Time 
    for learning was an issue, as the rules excluded payment for supply cover. 
    Other complaints from teachers included: inadequate needs identification; 
    rush to completion; accreditation being too easy or too hard; the value for 
    money of CD-ROM-based courses; content irrelevant to the classroom; inadequate 
    access and technical failures. Some ICT co-ordinators expressed concern about 
    being excluded; several teachers mentioned the strain the programme put on 
    the ICT co-ordinator.</p>
  <p>The evaluation found examples of mismatches between individual teachers’ 
    learning styles and their programmes. The survey provides information about 
    the kind of ICT programme that teachers prefer, but one size will never fit 
    all, and flexibility is key. Many ATPs had not anticipated the range of teachers’ 
    skill levels, and policy makers had to accept requests to allow basic skills 
    training, as many participants did not know enough about computers to follow 
    suggestions for classroom use.</p>
  <p>Much has changed since the programme was conceived in the 1990s. Evidence 
    of these changes like transformational learning, new leadership approaches, 
    whole school ICT development, practice-based research, creativity, ownership 
    of learning, communities of practice, and long-term CPD, appears in the report 
    on emergent trends drawn from fifteen successful school case studies, but 
    these were not elements of most programmes.</p>
  <p>Despite the criticisms of aspects of planning and delivery, an 80% pass rate 
    is a major achievement for all concerned. Access is also now much improved, 
    and the evidence suggests that the majority of teachers made progress by using 
    the programme as a springboard for further development. The next step should 
    now be to move from an instrumental view of ICT ‘training’ for teachers, into 
    a transformational mode of learning which seems to be the way that teachers 
    really want to go, both for themselves and for their students.</p>
