    Report</a> </p>
  <p> <strong>Summary<br>
    </strong>This ICT training programme for teachers was intended to concentrate 
    on the pedagogy of ICT in subject teaching. The Reflective Voices research 
    draws on the voices of as many participant groups as possible: teachers, senior 
    managers, school staff trainers, ICT coordinators, policy makers, quality 
    assurance agents, and the journalists who specialised in NOF training. In 
    this way the team hoped to seek evidence as widely as possible in order to 
    provide guidance about the best ways of helping teachers to use computers 
    intuitively in their teaching.</p>
  <p>The main aims of the research were</p>
  <ul>
    <li> to investigate the influence of critical features of NOF delivery that 
      provide lessons in ICT training for the wider teacher education community;</li>
    <li> to display the results of the investigation in a ways which are accessible 
      to future providers of similar training and of ITT. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The main thrust of the research was not only in identifying the good providers, 
    but going beyond that to identify what was good about the providers who were 
    being recommended. Accordingly the research focused on two main areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> why did good providers become rated as good? </li>
    <li> how did schools that used NOF well and benefited from it succeed in their 
      aims? </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong><a id="meth"></a>Research methodology<br>
    </strong>The principal issues were identified using published and other paper 
    sources, the previous research reports, by setting up online forums within 
    the professional organisations and by interviewing key policy makers. </p>
  <p>In order to meet the aims and objectives of the project a combination of 
    quantitative and qualitative research methods were agreed. Quantitative material 
    covered the type, perceived quality and cost effectiveness of the training 
    model that was used and the access the teacher had to a computer. </p>
  <p>The cohort covered a full range of training models and a wide range of school 
    and teacher characteristics. One thousand schools were surveyed at the end 
    of 2002. 638 replies were received. These replies were analysed to identify 
    the issues across the whole cohort. </p>
  <p>The free response section was been important in recording a full range of 
    views about the training programme in all contexts, not only where the programme 
    went well. </p>
  <p>Around 30 schools were selected which reported general satisfaction with 
    the training outcomes. A more probing questionnaire was sent which helped 
    to narrow the case study cohort, and also ensured a backup in case any of 
    the selected schools decide to back out of the project during the research. 
  </p>
  <p>Fifteen schools were selected as case studies which incorporated as wide 
    a range of circumstances, experiences and views as possible. In addition, 
    schools were chosen from contrasting localities and are of different types 
    in order to ensure as much diversity as possible (i.e. region, school age 
    phase, urban/rural, school type - foundation, girls, Church of England etc.) 
  </p>
  <p>The principles of selection for these case studies were established through 
    the survey data and the interviews conducted in the first months. The sample 
    size was agreed according to the distribution of schools in the country, five 
    secondary schools including one special school and ten primary schools. </p>
  <p>This was done by categorising responses to questions about the model of training 
    provided by the ten heads and five deputy heads who were directing the project 
    in the school. In order to ensure triangulation two other teachers were interviewed 
    in each school who were chosen by the NOF programme director as having differing 
    levels of competence and confidence: in all twelve ICT coordinators, eleven 
    classroom teachers and two teaching assistants were interviewed.</p>
  <p>The case study questions in the semi-structured interviews, were based on 
    the quantitative questionnaire data analysis, and other criteria for selection 
    agreed for example schools which had changed their ATP. </p>
  <p>Whilst the school-based study is the main focus of this research, a further 
    phase investigated the role, experience and perspectives of relevant ATPs. 
    This information was collected by semi-structured email questionnaires followed 
    up by telephone and face to face interviewing. </p>
  <p>All the players were also invited to respond to invitations to join forums 
    and to send opinions by email. </p>
  <p>The research publication will provide accounts of how critical issues in 
    delivery and receipt were dealt with. The identification of critical features 
    will be based on a critical use of expert opinion. The case studies will highlight 
    critical features from which lessons for future practice may be learned.</p>
