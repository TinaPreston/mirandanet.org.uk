    <h2>Teachers’ and Trainers’ Perspectives</h2>
  <p><strong>Researching the outcomes of the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) ICT 
    Teacher Training</strong></p>

  <p>An interim report has already been published on the features that schools 
    should look for when they are planning ICT training for staff.</p>
  <h2>Considerations for school planning ICT training</h2>
  <ol>
    <li> <a href="#one">How does the use of ICT fit into our established learning 
      culture?</a></li>
    <li> <a href="#two">An ICT CPD programme for the school staff</a></li>
    <li> <a href="#three">Funding staff development</a></li>
    <li> <a href="#four">Quality assurance, accreditation and evaluation</a></li>
  </ol>
  <p>The conclusions from this study suggest that learning technology can advance 
    the teaching and learning goals of schools. However the technology for learning 
    is changing all the time and schools need a continuous programme of ICT staff 
    development. </p>
  <p>These are some of the fundamental questions a senior management team will 
    want to ask in creating imaginative continuing professional development opportunities. 
    The questions are based on the trends emerging from research about effective 
    ICT programmes for teachers. However this is a complex area of school leadership. 
    Schools will often need to devise unique solutions that reflect local conditions.</p>
  <p><strong><a id="one"></a>1. How does the use of ICT fit into our established 
    learning culture? </strong> </p>
  <p>What do we already know as a team about current learning theory? What kind 
    of continuing professional development programme will improve and/or update 
    our cooperate knowledge in this area? Which staff already have some knowledge 
    and experience.</p>
  <p>Could external CPD programmes lead to the identification of innovative and 
    inclusive learning models?</p>
  <p>Could this CPD programmes lead to different kinds of evaluation of learning? 
  </p>
  <p> Do we expect ICT to impact on our school learning culture:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> as a catalyst to help students to be more independent learners;</li>
    <li> as a means of encouraging staff to think differently about teaching and 
      learning;</li>
    <li> as a means of raising standards in traditional curriculum subjects;</li>
    <li> as a resource to promote new field of learning like citizenship, creativity 
      and thinking skills;</li>
    <li> as a means of increasing contact with the home and national and international 
      communities?</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Where can we find evidence of achievement by other schools?</p>
  <p>How will other members of staff be engaged in this debate?</p>
  <p>How will the implementation of an ICT CPD programme impact on performance 
    in SATs and traditional exams? </p>
  <p>Does our school development plan reflect our views? </p>
  <p>Do we need to drop an aspect of staff training to make space for this initiative? 
  </p>
  <p> <strong><a id="two"></a>2. An ICT CPD programme for the school staff </strong></p>
  <p>Which senior manager will lead the project purposefully, involve the staff 
    and agree with them the pace of the project and how best to manage its implementation?</p>
  <p> Is there appropriate time and training for lead teachers and project managers?</p>
  <p>Can adequate time be prioritised for full staff involvement?</p>
  <p>How will we audit staff needs and deal with basic skills training?</p>
    <p>How can we allow for different teachers’ learning styles?</p>
  <p>What paths will we offer for teachers who do not wish to engage with the 
    programme?</p>
  <p>How can we help staff to develop an action plan which identifies ICT directions 
    that interest them and direct them to further consolidation of their practice 
    or the development of new skills areas?</p>
  <p>How can we encourage staff who elect to run experimental and innovative ICT 
    projects and help them to build in milestones and develop a portfolio of achievement? 
  </p>
  <p>How can we motivate and reward our staff: by access to online laptop computers, 
    support cover, accreditation, technical support, web publication of successful 
    projects?</p>
  <p>How will we ensure that the achievement of the project outcomes is discussed 
    with individuals as a part of the cycle of professional review and development?</p>
  <p>Do teachers of different subjects require different approaches to CPD programmes? 
    How will this be pursued?</p>
  <p>How many different kinds of accreditation should we offer to suit staff diversity?</p>
  <p>Will elearning facilities extend opportunities for staff learning? </p>
  <p>How will we select external agencies to support the ICT programme and who 
    will liaise with them?</p>
  <p> <strong><a id="three"></a>3. Funding staff development </strong></p>
    <p>How much do we know about government and local authority funding for teachers’ 
      professional development in relation to the National Grid for Learning?</p>
  <p>What European Union funding channels could be used to increase staff links 
    beyond the classroom? </p>
  <p>Would the Becta teachers awards, DfES Best Practice Research Bursaries and 
    Teachers’ International professional Development awards from the British 
    Council be useful CPD funding route?</p>
  <p>Could our local community and experienced teachers and students provide workshops 
    and mentoring for staff? </p>
  <p>Do we have a funded broadband infrastructure provided by the government and/or 
    the local region?</p>
  <p>Do we have enough hardware, econtent and staff access to make ICT CPD a viable 
    option? </p>
  <p>Do we have enough money to pay for maintenance, repair and consumables if 
    we use the system more? </p>
  <p>Can we invest in experimental projects with devices like wireless tablets 
    or interactive whiteboards? </p>
  <p>Are we clear about our approaches to teaching IT and teaching ICT across 
    the curriculum? </p>
  <p><strong><a id="four"></a>4. Quality assurance, accreditation and evaluation</strong></p>
  <p>How will we know when we are achieving our ICT programme objectives in terms 
    of the quality of implementation, the quality of achievement of the outcomes 
    and the impact of the training on professional practice?</p>
  <p>How can we make sure that constructive learning, collaboration and risk taking 
    are adequately rewarded?</p>
  <p>How can we share the results of practice based evidence from classroom research 
    by teachers? Will there be time to share the case studies and learn from them?</p>
  <p>What will the feedback and reporting cycle be and who will be involved? </p>
  <p>Can we celebrate teachers and students learning achievements on our website? 
  </p>
  <p>How will we monitor the impact of continuing professional development across 
    the staff?</p>
  <p>How will we integrate new ways of working and innovative assessment methods 
    into traditional practice?</p>
  <p>Will students be involved in the evaluation and self evaluation process?
