  <h2><small>Christina Preston</small></h2>
  <p><em>A shorter version of this article appeared in The Independent on 19 November 
    1998</em></p>
  <p>Teachers are overwhelmed with advice on how to do their job from government 
    officials, inspectors, parents and journalists. Teaching is no longer a profession, 
    it's a job that everyone, it seems, knows how to do better than a teacher.</p>
  <p>The teacher beleaguered with all this unsolicited advice has no professional 
    body which can develop good practice and promote mastery of a changing role. 
    A self-regulating General Teaching Council has often been suggested but seems 
    to be no nearer fruition. Meanwhile, teachers have few platforms to speak, 
    unless the tabloids unearth a sinner.</p>
  <p>Opportunities to meet their peers to exchange good practice have decreased 
    since the local management schools' policy gave heads the power to direct 
    staff professional development. Heads are reluctant to pay the cost of a cover 
    teacher. Teachers themselves worry about the disruption to their classes when 
    they are absent. Many teachers, with families, cannot commit to evening or 
    weekend classes to up date themselves. As a result, many local training centres 
    and in service courses in the universities have disappeared. This leads to 
    professional isolation, a major causes of demoralisation.</p>
  <h3>Teachers teaching teachers</h3>
  <p>There are some professional groups based in the universities which aim to 
    alleviate this isolation by promoting school based research into school effectiveness. 
    Conferences to celebrate effective change in schools in London are held by 
    the Effective Schools and Standards Unit and the Leadership Centres led by 
    the Institute of Education, London University, Sheffield and Bath. The British 
    Computer Schools Committee also supports working groups of teachers and teacher 
    educators who are publishing on current topics. This years subjects include 
    Schools of the Future, The Internet, Early Years as well as the internationally 
    recognised Glossary.</p>
  <p>MirandaNet is another professional development organisation designed to provide 
    an opportunity to mentor and support teachers as they make changes in the 
    classroom using Information and Communications Technologies. Shortened to 
    ICT, this new name for IT emphasises world wide communications with peers. 
    This aspect of computers has a wide appeal amongst teachers, especially women.</p>
  <p>For example teachers in MirandaNet have found the benefits of using a web 
    site to publish their case studies for others. In a closed conference group 
    they debate teaching and learning issues and to mentor their peers. They also 
    partner curriculum exchange projects with their peers all over the world, 
    opening the intellectual windows of their classrooms and creating real audiences 
    for the pupils.</p>
  <h3>Teachers as Learners</h3>
  <p>The impressive government strategy to connect all schools and libraries by 
    2002 on the National Grid for Learning can provide a strategy for the teaching 
    profession to change its image and alleviate its isolation. NGFL offers an 
    opportunity for teachers of all subject to receive these professional benefits 
    and improve classroom learning.</p>
  <p>The NGFL document, 'Open for Learning, Open for Business', published last 
    week, boasts that one billion pounds is being invested in the hardware and 
    in raising the competence of teachers and librarians &quot;to develop ICT 
    confidence in school-leavers and make Britain a world leader in the field 
    of digital learning.&quot;</p>
  <p>Or is this a virtual bridge beyond the teachers reach? The authority of a 
    teacher is challenged by the vast repository of current information which 
    reposes on the Internet. Do established, traditional teachers who see themselves 
    as experts and authorities want to be formal learners again?. If they fear 
    the changes that computers might bring BT's Peter Cochrane will not comfort 
    them. &quot;In the future there will only be two types of teacher: ICT literate 
    or retired.&quot; But statistics from a US study by Market Data Retrieval 
    are a warning: 85% of schools have Internet access but only 14% of teacher 
    use the Web as a teaching resource.</p>
  <p>Computers are one catalyst in the inevitable changes in the teachers' role. 
    Tony Blair's preface to 'Open for Learning, Open for Business' suggests, &quot;We 
    are all learners. This paper presents a challenge to all of us as individuals 
    to engage with new ways of learning and working&quot;. The key to new learning 
    strategies lies in multimedia communications technologies. But if this government 
    seriously wants teachers to make a paradigm change in the way they operate, 
    politicians will have to start appealing to teachers' hearts and minds, starting 
    with a celebration of the teachers' art, rather than unrelieved assessment 
    and inspection.</p>
  <p>What do expert teachers of teachers think? At a conference, organised by 
    the British Education Research Association and MirandaNet in London last week, 
    Does the Net add value to Learning? teachers agreed that computers provide 
    exciting learning opportunities. The conference was sponsored by BT and Oracle 
    whose education products are improving the on-line provision of classroom 
    resources. The teacher delegates liked demonstrations of learning environments 
    offering remote on-line teaching modules, measured and tested electronically.</p>
  <h3>Changes in the classroom</h3>
  <p>But these teachers, already expert and enthusiastic in the use of electronic 
    networks in staffrooms and classrooms, did not accept that teaching is merely 
    the authoritarian transmission of knowledge. Their teaching and learning on-line 
    involved refining traditional classroom roles as well as identifying new professional 
    skills. These roles were described as instructors, content-providers, learning 
    managers, facilitators, cheer-leaders, moderators, creators, inventors, learners, 
    researchers, entertainment officers, verifiers and validators.</p>
  <p>In the ICT context teachers saw themselves as lion-tamers, pretending control 
    in classrooms with unpredictable computers. They also have to come to terms 
    with constantly asking their pupils for assistance with the 'lions'.</p>
  <p>The teachers had some advice for the Teacher Training Agency which is about 
    to review bids for providing ICT teacher training resources on-line. John 
    Meadows, a teacher educator at South Bank University, reported that teachers 
    wanted their own computers on line for use from home so that they could teach 
    themselves the skills. They wanted guidance in a pedagogical overview of how 
    ICT should change their role. They valued on-line peer tutoring, advice on 
    classroom management and information on what outcomes are required. Significantly, 
    they wanted to read about other teachers' experiences and debate strategies.</p>
  <p>John Cuthell, a MirandaNet Fellow, explained how MirandaNet helped this process 
    of sharing. From the experience of the Intranet at his school, Boston Spa, 
    West Yorkshire which is heavily used and constantly changing, he thought that 
    on-line learning was more effective for teachers than children.</p>
  <blockquote>&quot; On-line instruction requires the skills of a good primary 
    school teacher. The pedagogical and social requirements promote the features 
    necessary to maintain a learning environment in a class room where individuals 
    move at different speeds. This is, perhaps, the shift for adults learning 
    to teach on-line: that content becomes of less importance than process for 
    the teacher - or instructor, or trainer. Learning to teach on-line is essentially 
    experiential, and those learning how to do so need to experience the potential 
    sufferings of our students.&quot;</blockquote>
  <p>But time is essential for professional development. Squeezing teachers learning 
    space into the school day and edging the rest of the family off the home computer 
    is not a trivial matter. Teachers recommended on-line computers for all teachers, 
    the standardisation of systems, flexitime and scaleable technologies as reliable 
    as the telephone.</p>
  <h3>Incentives for teachers to learn</h3>
  <p>Motivation is a key factor in teachers' learning These teachers were tempted 
    by the promise of an adventure for the mind. The appeal of these services 
    was the opportunity to engage with other teachers in debate, to maintain independent 
    critical review of publications, services and tools, the chance to publish 
    their own work and to fly intellectually beyond the classroom walls.</p>
  <p>These professionals wanted confidentiality as well. They all disliked the 
    Grid's registration form that asks for age. nationality and other personal 
    details. To avoid the Big Brother syndrome one idea which has developed from 
    the teaching community is a TeacherNetUK, a service designed to provide continuing 
    professional development just as regional Teachers Centres, where they still 
    exist, provide support for teachers. Conceived as an independent organisation 
    run by teachers for teachers, TeacherNetUK would act as a bank for teachers' 
    information as well as storing lifelong learning accounts. In partnership 
    with Oracle Corporation, TNUK have been developing 'profiling' and 'push' 
    systems which will respond intelligently to the teachers expressed interests 
    in professional development. The 250 million pounds Loterry money set aside 
    by government to create resources for teacher training should ensure appropriate 
    software and materials. Does the profession need an independent service of 
    this kind to provide a grassroots infrastructure for a General Teaching Council 
    by promoting a genuine debate across the profession? If the National Grid 
    for Learning supports services that celebrate and support the profession, 
    teachers might find that sufficient incentive to get wired and 'go'.</p>
