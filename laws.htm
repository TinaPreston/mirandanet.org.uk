    <p>Katherine Watson</p>
    <p>14th November2012</p>
    <p>Dear Katherine</p>
    <p><strong>Subject: Information and Communications Technology (ICT)</strong></p>
    <p>Thank you for your <a href="joint_ITT_letter.htm">email of 19 October</a>, 
      addressed to the Secretary of State, about the recently announced removal 
      of ICT courses for 2013/14. I am replying as the Minister responsible for 
      this policy area.</p>
    <p>I am grateful to you for writing in such great detail, along with Ms Christina 
      Preston and Mr Mark Chambers, highlighting your areas of concern.</p>
    <p>You ask whether computer science initial teacher training (ITT) courses 
      will contain content on information technology and digital literacy, as 
      there will be a need for teachers to cover all three of these elements in 
      delivering the revised ICT Programmes of Study when these come into force 
      in September 2014. As a recent communication from the Teaching Agency has 
      clarified, computer science ITT courses can cover other aspects of ICT. 
      It is the responsibility of providers, working with schools, to define and 
      design the specifics of computer science ITT programmes, which must produce 
      teachers capable of teaching to at least GCSE level in the subject and have 
      &#8216;computer science&#8217; in their title. As long as these conditions 
      are met, programmes can include other elements of the ICT curriculum. ITT 
      courses are not exclusively related to the named subject of the allocated 
      places. For example, in science, training places are allocated specifically 
      to physics, chemistry and biology, with trainees required to teach the specialism 
      at Key Stage 4 &#8212; but there is nothing to stop the training from covering 
      general science at Key Stage 3.</p>
    <p>You also point out that appropriately skilled teachers will be needed to 
      cater for current Key Stage 3 and 4 pupils who are taking ICT exams. We 
      will still be training teachers in ICT during 2012/13 to become newly qualified 
      teachers, and there &iexcl;s a large population of existing ICT teachers 
      in schools already. To maintain existing ICT ITT courses, given the long-term 
      developments in the subject area, would be a waste of public money and give 
      any future Key Stage 4 ICT trainees very poor future employment prospects.</p>
    <p>You also express concern over the number of new specialist computing teachers 
      being trained, and recommend that the number of training places on qualifying 
      courses &iexcl;s doubled to bring the total to 1000. The Department has 
      projected, on the basis of the best evidence available, that 560 training 
      places are required to satisfy the current demand for teachers to meet ICT/computer 
      science requirements. The Teaching Agency has met the demands of the system 
      through its allocations &#8212; and as a result of School Direct requests, 
      as well as bids from ITT providers, 835 computer science places have now 
      been allocated. Further trainees are also expected to take up the subject 
      via the Teach First initiative. These teachers will enter the workforce 
      in 201 4, and schools will be providing continuing professional development 
      (CPD) to up-skill their current teachers. There is, therefore, time for 
      the system to adapt before the revised ICT curriculum is introduced. Training 
      places for computer science, along with those for other subjects, will continue 
      to be reviewed annually and adjusted as the demand for such teachers rises 
      or falls.</p>
    <p>You point out that the policy of removing all ICT ITT courses does not 
      distinguish between those existing ICT courses that already train computer 
      science specialists who are able to teach to GCSE level, and those which 
      need to be redesigned from the ground up. You recommend that an audit is 
      conducted of existing provision to help identify which providers can best 
      offer computer science courses, and those placed to offer more hybrid ICT 
      and computing courses for delivery in 2013/14. The position here is that 
      if an accredited ITT provider currently runs a computer science course which 
      has been approved to develop and deliver computer science programmes, they 
      can request that any computer science course they currently run which is 
      badged as ICT can be renamed. It is up to the provider to ensure that the 
      course matches the required content &#8212; if it does not, the provider 
      potentially risks its accreditation.</p>
    <p>You stress the importance of communicating decisions on computer science 
      ITT course allocations to providers and potential applicants at the earliest 
      possible opportunity, and the need to make clear which providers will receive 
      allocations for teacher training, for how many places, and in what areas. 
      The results of the computer science ITT allocations for both providers and 
      School Direct bids have been distributed in line with the agreed schedule.</p>
    <p>You contend that computer science teaching at Key Stage 4 is not yet well 
      established in schools, and that the BCS Network of Computer Science Teaching 
      Excellence may not be extensive enough for providers to work with &#8212; 
      through School Direct or PGCE &#8212; to meet recruitment requirements. 
      You ask whether Ofsted will be told to be lenient in inspecting the new 
      computer science ITT training courses for a two year period, while more 
      schools develop Key Stage 4 courses and links between schools and providers 
      can be facilitated. The Department cannot instruct Ofsted to be lenient, 
      as Ofsted is an independent and impartial body that reports directly to 
      Parliament. The Teaching Agency has kept Mr David Brown, National Advisor 
      for ICT, informed of the changes, and regularly meets with Ofsted&#8217;s 
      ITT inspection division. The Teaching Agency will express the view that 
      those on the &#8216;front line&#8217; in schools need reassurance that Ofsted 
      recognises that it will take time for schools and providers to implement 
      the computer science component of the revised ICT Programmes of Study, not 
      least because of CPD workforce issues.</p>
    <p>You stress the importance of getting Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) 
      courses in place as soon as possible, and marketed by the providers selected 
      to deliver them. I understand that as the computer science ITT programmes 
      develop, there will be a need to put in place courses to offer graduates 
      of other subjects pre-ITT courses in computer science. We are, therefore, 
      opening up a bidding round for computer science SKE courses starting this 
      academic year, for trainees commencing computer science ITT courses in 2013/14. 
      Providers have already been asked to submit an outline of their proposals 
      along with the numbers of places and length of courses they wish to deliver. 
      Courses will be of appropriate length (from 2 to 36 weeks duration) to enable 
      trainees to acquire the requisite level of subject knowledge.</p>
    <p>You also suggest that consideration should be given to awarding computer 
      science trainees the highest priority bursary rates, as received by other 
      specialised science colleagues. The Department reviews financial incentives 
      regularly and will do so again before we announce arrangements for 2014/1 
      5. We consider carefully whether a higher amount would increase the quality 
      of trainees, balanced against the very significant cost of bursaries as 
      a recruitment tool. There has been a long history of recruiting too few 
      chemistry and physics teachers, while those recruited are, on average, of 
      lower quality than in other subjects. For this reason, these subjects currently 
      attract the most generous bursaries. This is not the case with all specialist 
      science places: biology places, where the record of recruitment is stronger, 
      receive less generous bursaries.</p>
    <p>Thank you again for writing on these important issues. I would be grateful 
      if you would share this letter with Ms Preston and Mr Chambers.</p>
    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
    <p>David Laws MP</p>
