    <h3><a name="next"></a>The Future of Learning: Shift 2</h3>
    <p>Many advocates of e-learning express frustration with politicians and public 
      servants who &quot;don&#8217;t get&quot; the potential of digital technologies 
      to transform educational opportunities through professional innovation. 
      This comes despite a growing body of evidence from many projects over many 
      years. Now it is time for MirandaNet members to publish what they think.</p>
<!--     <p>Dr Chris Yapp, one of the orginal authors of Shift Happens (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljbI-363A2Q">www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljbI-363A2Q</a> 
      and <a href="http://shifthappens.wikispaces.com/">http://shifthappens.wikispaces.com</a>) 
      invites MirandaNet members to collaborate on a 'book' called, provisionally,<em> 
      Pervasive Learning: Facing the Challenges of the 21st Century</em>, to be 
      published by Routledge. Contributors and readers will be able to continue 
      sharing ideas in a MirandaNet forum.</p>
    <p>All contributors to the debate will be acknowledged in the book for sharing 
      their thinking about the future of learning that we cannot predict with 
      accuracy. Various kinds of accreditation can also be for more substantive 
      contributions to the forum.</p>
    <p>There will be four sessions that can be attended online or face to face:</p>
    <h4>Designing education for the future as if it matters: Schools and Schooling 
      in the Digital Age </h4>
    <p>30th November 2010 - University of Bedfordshire</p>
    <h4>How can educators develop World Ecitizens?</h4>
    <p>January 14th - BETT12, London</p>
    <h4>Curriculum and Assessment for an Uncertain World </h4>
    <p> 1st March 2011 - University of Bedfordshire</p>
    <h4>Can teachers be learners and leaders? The changing status of expert professionals. 
    </h4>
    <p>16th May 2011 (TBC) University of Bedfordshire</p>
    <p><strong>Spotlight on the Themes</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Target contributors</strong>: professionals across the world with 
      an interest in where learning is going</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The purpose of these sessions is to look at schools 
      and schooling from an organisational and systems theory and technology leadership 
      perspective, rather than the usage of IT in the classroom. </p>
    <p><strong>Aim</strong>: The aim of these sessions is to stimulate thinking 
      about creating frameworks for thinking about the &#8220;macro&#8221; problems 
      of educational transformation.</p>
    <p><strong>Schools and Schooling in the Digital Age</strong></p>
    <p>Information technology provides opportunities to redesign how organisations 
      work and how organisations interact with the outside world. Building on 
      the idea that &#8220;It takes a Global Village to Educate a Child&#8221;, 
      this session will look at how the system of education could be radically 
      reconstituted to create educational opportunities at scale for an increasingly 
      borderless world, while at the same time responding to the drive for economic 
      efficiency.</p>
    <p><strong>Curriculum and Assessment for an Uncertain World</strong></p>
    <p>Building on the opening session, this session looks at how the large-scale 
      models of organisation and the notions of personalised learning can be reconciled. 
      The central part of this session is to consider how a personal curriculum 
      can be built over time to shape a nation&#8217;s needs to global standards. 
      This notion, in turn, leads us to question the purpose and practice of the 
      assessment of assessment for learning.</p>
    <p><strong>Development of the Learning Professionals</strong></p>
    <p>Whatever else changes, I do not believe that the quality of an educational 
      system can or will be better than the quality of the teaching professionals. 
      The recruitment, development and retention of the workforce are the themes 
      of this third theme.</p>
    <p>Over the working life of new entrants to teaching, developments in scientific 
      understanding of the brain and human learning will probably impact on our 
      notions of teaching and learning. This session will develop the notion of 
      teachers as researchers as a model for continuous professional development 
      to meet the challenges of the first two sessions.</p>
    <p><strong>How can educators develop World Ecitizens?</strong></p>
    <p><a href="https://wec.mirandanet.org.uk/">www.worldecitizens.net</a></p>
    <p>The MirandaNet Fellowship is an international professional organisation 
      of those with an interest in the value of digital technologies in educational 
      innovation. The membership also believe in the value of digital technologies 
      for collaboration, friendship and understanding across national boundaries 
      and cultures. After the events in New York of 9/11 the Fellows set up a 
      charity called World Ecitizens an online environment that provides a resource 
      for educational collaboration in topics such as responsible citizenship, 
      mutual respect, combating social injustice and conflict prevention and resolution.</p>
    <p>Colleagues are invited to join these two World Ecitizens (WE) MirandaMods 
      with the aim of encouraging understanding between the educators who attend, 
      online or face to face, and their communities in order to share the fascinating 
      diversity within nations and across the world. WE take responsibility for 
      our actions and strive to make the world a better place.</p>
    <h2><a name="definition" id="definition"></a>What is a MirandaMod?</h2>
    <p>MirandaMod is an informal, loosely structured <strong>unconference</strong> 
      (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">see Wikipedia definition</a>) 
      of like-minded educators to share ideas about the use of technology to inspire 
      others. We hope they will become a regular feature in the MirandaNet calendar. 
      It is likely that MirandaMods will usually (but not always) be a fringe 
      event following or attached to a formal MirandaNet seminar/workshop or meeting. 
      It is hoped to establish an International dimension to this event.</p>
 -->    <p>Historically Mod comes from the
        Gaelic word
        for a gathering, assembly or parliament.*</p>

    <p>It is always free to attend a MirandaMod (and you will be fed and watered)<br />
      There will be a Wifi connection, so please bring your laptops etc</p>
    <h3><a name="definition"></a>Some Background</h3>
    <p>* Borrowing its name from the MirandaNet community and
        the Gaelic word for a 'gathering or assembly', MirandaMod acknowledges
        its indebtedness
          to other unconferences, especially <a href="http://teachmeet.pbwiki.com/">Teachmeet</a>, under
          whose banner the original MirandaNet unconference was going to fly.
          However, organisational considerations
          mean that MirandaMod has to meet a different set of criteria to Teachmeet.
          We see MirandaMod as an addition, rather than a competitor, to Teachmeet
          in the educational unconference world, and it is more than likely
      that members of the MirandaMod community will be involved with Teachmeet
      events and vice versa.</p>
