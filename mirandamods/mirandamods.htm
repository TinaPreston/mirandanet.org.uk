    <h3>Recent MirandaMods</h3>
    <h3>BETT11 MirandaMods</h3>
    <p>Professional knowledge building resources from three years of MirandaMods 
      can be found on the <a href="index.html">MirandaMods</a> 
      section of our website. The resources from the BETT11 week in London from 
      12th -15th January, listed below, also provide a taster of what to expect 
      from the Education Show (March MirandaMods) as they are all about themes 
      from Achievement for All.</p>
<p>At Olympia, London the MirandaNet team ran four MirandaMods on Achievement for All themes: three on the stand and one in a seminar room. The quality of the resources captured in the room was better than on the stand because the glass and metal roof of Olympia were not acoustically sympathetic.</p>
<p>The events had been marketed by MirandaNet for about two months before BETT11. Before and during the events information issues from the debates were tweeted and re-tweeted to about 500 educators. Some responded on the Twitter stream and others joined the Flash meeting and commented there. Members from Australia, Greece and Gambia who could not obtain the funding to come to BETT11 attended all the debates as a form of Continuing Professional Development. There will be more in the next newsletter about these contributions.</p>
<p>The MirandaNet team now have significant experience in leveraging these social media streams to great effect as the MirandaNet community become more sophisticated in their capacity to share professional knowledge stimulated by expert speakers and participant educators. The potential for outreach is for the AFA community is significant as they learn to use the technology comfortably.</p>
    <p>Leading on the MirandaNet/Achievement for All web pages are the talks from 
      the three expert speakers to set the theme: Professor Sonia Blandford on 
      Achievement for all; Dr. Chris Yapp on the implications for future learning 
      and Professor Marilyn Leask on the value of communities of practice in professional 
      learning. Also on the website will be the videostream and FlashMeeting record 
      of the four events, including the transcript. Collaborative maps also present 
      the professional knowledge that was collected.</p>
    <p>The MirandaNet team comment that the quality of the MirandaMod resources 
      is good, given this is an 'outside broadcast' but obviously event better 
      results have been achieved in the studio at the WLE centre, Institute of 
      Education, University of London funded by HEFCE and Becta. However, this 
      a small, agile and committed group that can set up a broadcast unit and 
      produce results much faster than a media company and with more authentic 
      results, because we are all committed educators. From this set of MirandaMods 
      at BETT11 we discovered a number of things that will improve our &quot;outside 
      broadcast technique&quot; for the Education Show. The equipment at MirandaNet&rsquo;s 
      disposal and the limited bandwidth from the stand were challenging. More 
      members need to be trained to co-ordinate all the digital streams.</p>
<p>These are the opening resources:</p>

    <h3>MirandaMods at the Education Show, Birmingham, March 17th - 19th 2011</h3>
    <p>The MirandaMod sessions at the Education Show in Birmingham March 17th 
      -19th considered what comes next in digital technologies in association 
      with colleagues from the Department for Education and the Achievement for 
      All Strategy. There were six workshops over three days with the focus on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>assessment and learning;</li>
      <li>classroom support;</li>
      <li>leadership;</li>
      <li>the future of SEN policy and SEND practice;</li>
      <li>educational disadvantage;</li>
      <li>parental engagement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Professor Sonia Blandford talked about Achievement for All: Impact and 
      practice following the Lamb inquiry. The MirandaNet team encouraged feedback 
      from the participants and assisted with the videoing, creating maps and 
      so on. The team aslo ran one of the workshops on Thursday afternoon, 17th 
      March when our topic wase 'ICT policy and practice in Achievement for All 
      contexts'. In this workshop we paid tribute to what Becta has achieved and 
      undertook some collaborative thinking about what the ICT community needs 
      to do next. </p>

    <h3>Resources from the Games Based Learning Conference</h3>
    <p>MirandaNet ran a well attended MirandaMod at the Games Based Learning conference. 
      After the event Graham Brown Marting reports: the Game Based Learning Conference 
      was attended by more than 400 international delegates for a stimulating, 
      inspiring and possibly exhausting 2 days.</p>
    <p>By all accounts it was a success with engaging and provocative conversations 
      sparked during the event itself, on Twitter where the event consistently 
      trended and now continuing amongst various online communities.</p>

      <li>Should textbooks still have value in a 21st Century educational system?</li>
      <li>Is the school day on the way out?</li>
      <li>Should there a place for social media in class?</li>

    <p>HCICTE 2010 covers technological, pedagogical, organizational, instructional,
      as well as policy aspects of ICT in Education and e-Learning. Special emphasis
      is given to applied research relevant to educational practice guided by
      the educational realities in schools, colleges, universities and informal
      learning organizations. In a more generic scope, the Conference aims to
      encompass broader issues determining ICT integration in practice, including
      learning and teaching, curriculum and instructional design, learning media
      and environments, teacher education and professional development, assessment
    and evaluation, etc.</p>

    <h3>&#8216;Mobile learning, handheld learning?&#8217; What do we mean? </h3>
    <p>The presentations during the seminar considered the issues of mobile and 
      handheld learning from four key perspectives: the different mediums in which 
      learning now takes place informally; the value to teachers of digital resources; 
      the scholarly underpinnings of this developing area and the influence of 
      companies on the directions taken by schools in implementing the associated 
      hardware and software. In the MirandaMod that followed Elizabeth Hartnell-Young 
      joined the debate from New Zealand. Other contributors came from across 
      the United Kingdom. Two of the conclusions were that: to make mobile and 
      handheld learning worth the investment there needed to be significant changes 
      in classroom practice and assessment; and, as a profession we still do not 
      know enough about the process of collaborative knowledge creation online.    </p>

    <h2><a name="definition" id="definition"></a>What is a MirandaMod?</h2>
    <p>MirandaMod is an informal, loosely structured <strong>unconference</strong> 
      (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">see Wikipedia definition</a>) 
      of like-minded educators to share ideas about the use of technology to inspire 
      others. We hope they will become a regular feature in the MirandaNet calendar. 
      It is likely that MirandaMods will usually (but not always) be a fringe 
      event following or attached to a formal MirandaNet seminar/workshop or meeting. 
      It is hoped to establish an International dimension to this event.</p>
    <p>Historically Mod comes from the
        Gaelic word
        for a gathering, assembly or parliament.*</p>

    <p>It is always free to attend a MirandaMod (and you will be fed and watered)<br />
      There will be a Wifi connection, so please bring your laptops etc</p>
    <h3>Some Background</h3>
    <p>* Borrowing its name from the MirandaNet community and
        the Gaelic word for a 'gathering or assembly', MirandaMod acknowledges
        its indebtedness
          to other unconferences, especially <a href="http://teachmeet.pbwiki.com/">Teachmeet</a>, under
          whose banner the original MirandaNet unconference was going to fly.
          However, organisational considerations
          mean that MirandaMod has to meet a different set of criteria to Teachmeet.
          We see MirandaMod as an addition, rather than a competitor, to Teachmeet
          in the educational unconference world, and it is more than likely
      that members of the MirandaMod community will be involved with Teachmeet
      events and vice versa.</p>
