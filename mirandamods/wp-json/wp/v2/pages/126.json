But that \u201cserial\u201d model of video transmission or streaming can also be wasteful if you wish to amplify live streaming socially. All that is needed \u2013 and it is what people hit upon in the MirandaMod sessions \u2013 is to add a Digital Video camera on a tripod to a computer where a group of people are meeting and then show the FlashMeeting on a whiteboard in that room as well. You then immediately magnify the social interactions and make them highly dynamic.<br \/>\nFor the FlashMeeting one of the participants will be identified as #MMAfA. One of the technologies of the MirandaMod involves using a link to the FlashMeeting though a computer and camera in the face-to-face session. This enables participants who are unable to be present to view the meeting, to comment and to ask questions of the speakers. This extends the liminal space for learning.<\/p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"http:\/\/flashmeeting.e2bn.net\/fm\/fmm.php?pwd=d2249f-14666\">view the meeting<\/a>\u00a0or\u00a0download a PDF file <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/am-Flashmeeting.pdf\">am Flashmeeting<\/a> of the minutes.<br \/>\nMirandaNet would like to thank the <a title=\"University of Bedfordshire students\" href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/events\/mirandanet-bett12-programme-11th-14th-january-london\/workshop-sessions-at-bett12\/university-of-bedfordshire-students\/\">students from the University of Bedfordshire<\/a>, who provided invaluable technical support for the team throughout the sessions.
