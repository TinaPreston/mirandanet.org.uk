Their research really does seem to have its finger on the pulse.<br \/>\nThat is why MirandaNet is so important.<\/p>\n<p>But more than that &#8211; it was a joy to see practitioners from around the<br \/>\nworld pop in and join the discussion not only in person at the BETT exhibition,<br \/>\nbut also virtually as well.
