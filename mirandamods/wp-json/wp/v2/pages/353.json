It will give you time to upload any files you wish to use, familiarise yourself with the functionality, and so on. You can also set up your own account if you don&#8217;t already have one.<\/p>\n<p>Those of you want to present let me know and I&#8217;ll put you into the schedule. Aim for a 10-minute presentation slot. I hope to have a live stream sorted out as well. Bear in mind the time-lapse between live streams and Flashmeeting, and the clash between the speakers and microphone on your computer. These then relay themselves to everyone through an ever-worsening loop. Some of you may remember the problems that we had in an earlier MirandaMod last November. Use a headphone\/microphone setup and you&#8217;ll avoid that problem. As will we.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: bold;\">University of Bedfordshire<br \/>\nMay 3rd, 1300-1530 Room P1.20<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: bold;\"><\/strong><em>A workshop: An \u2018un\u2019 what?
