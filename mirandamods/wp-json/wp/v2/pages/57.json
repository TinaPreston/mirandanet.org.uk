She was a member of <em>Making<br \/>\nGames: developing game-authoring software for educational and creative<br \/>\nuse<\/em> (September\u00a02003-August 2006). The project investigated computer game making for<br \/>\nmedia literacy, and developed a software prototype to enable 11-14 year\u00a0olds\u00a0create their own games. Particular points of focus were the relationship\u00a0between gender and play, games and contemporary forms of literacy, and\u00a0participatory approaches to software design. She is course leader for\u00a0the MA Psychosocial Studies and Education and also leads the module Education\u00a0and Technology in Clinical Practice: perspectives and issues.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ioe.ac.uk\/study\/LCCN_67.html\">www.ioe.ac.uk\/study\/LCCN_67.html<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Caroline reminded us that many educationalists have argued that playing\u00a0computer games can be understood as a form of learning, and that games\u00a0could be used productively as a teaching resource in mainstream education.<br \/>\nWhen games are portrayed as educational, certain aspects are emphasised:<br \/>\ntheir interactivity, which allows players to dictate the pace of learning;<br \/>\nthe pleasure they give, which makes learning more motivating; and the control<br \/>\nthey give to players, which allows a less didactic, more participatory\u00a0approach to learning.<\/p>\n<p>In this presentation, Caroline argues that notions of interactivity, pleasure,<br \/>\nmotivation and empowerment are however often poorly defined. Advocates<br \/>\nof game-based learning often mean different things by these terms. Caroline<br \/>\nreviews four positions in the literature on game-based learning, outlining<br \/>\nthe different ideas they demonstrate about how games are interactive, motivating<br \/>\nand empowering. Each position has implications for thinking about how games<br \/>\ncan be treated as educational resources. The last position, which extends<br \/>\nBrecht\u2019s and Boal\u2019s theories of educational theatre, has received<br \/>\nthe least attention in the policy and research literature. Caroline argues<br \/>\nthat more work could be done in this vein to exploit the potential of games<br \/>\nin education.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/ftp\/Mirandanet_talk_on_games.ppt\">Download Caroline&#8217;s slides<br \/>\nPowerPoint<\/a> (86KB)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><object width=\"600\" height=\"372\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"src\" value=\"http:\/\/blip.tv\/play\/gr8cgcy7NwA\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><embed width=\"600\" height=\"372\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http:\/\/blip.tv\/play\/gr8cgcy7NwA\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" \/><\/object><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dawn Hallybone:<br \/>\nGames in classrooms: enhancing the curriculum and engaging learners<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Dawn who is an award winning classroom teacher at Oakdale Junior School<br \/>\ngave a convincing presentation about the value of games in schools.

He said<br \/>\nthat \u201clike all strong, contemporary cultural pressures which have<br \/>\nanti-educational potential, teachers need to be aware of the complete landscape<br \/>\nof computer games, if they are to make informed decisions about their use<br \/>\nas part of teaching or learning. The relationship between the US defence<br \/>\nindustry and gaming technologies is especially informative here, since<br \/>\ncomputer games have been used to train soldiers to great effect, but with<br \/>\nserious and lasting psychological consequences. The principles and drivers<br \/>\nof those games are identical to those used by mainstream commercial companies<br \/>\nto attract and engage their teenage users.\u201d After hearing from the<br \/>\nteachers who are using games in classrooms he said that the MirandaMod<br \/>\ndebate reminded him that games are a routine tool in any skilled teachers&#8217;<br \/>\ntoolbox, and that one of the most difficult things to get right about their<br \/>\nuse, is not technology but timing.<\/p>\n<p>Visit Joe&#8217;s blog: <a href=\"http:\/\/joenutt.squarespace.com\/\">http:\/\/joenutt.squarespace.com<\/a> (There&#8217;s<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>an entry that many will find interesting &#8211; &#8220;More drivel about computer<br \/>\ngames&#8221;)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/ftp\/MirandaMod_Mar10_JN.ppt\">Download Joe&#8217;s PowerPoint<\/a> (1MB)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>His MirandaNet talk is here:<\/p>\n<p><object width=\"600\" height=\"394\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"src\" value=\"http:\/\/blip.tv\/play\/gr8cgczDcwA\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><embed width=\"600\" height=\"394\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http:\/\/blip.tv\/play\/gr8cgczDcwA\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" \/><\/object><\/p>\n<p><strong>Chris Binns:<br \/>\nThinkQuest: a collaborative venture<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Chris&#8217; Presentation:<\/p>\n<p><object width=\"600\" height=\"394\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"src\" value=\"http:\/\/blip.tv\/play\/gr8cgczbTwA\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><embed width=\"600\" height=\"394\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http:\/\/blip.tv\/play\/gr8cgczbTwA\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" \/><\/object><\/p>\n<p>Chaired by Terry Freedman<\/p>\n<p>Partnered by Oracle ThinkQuest<br \/>\n(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thinkquest.org\/en\/\">www.thinkquest.org<\/a>)<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"gbl\"><\/a>MirandaMod, Monday 29th March 2010<\/h2>\n<h3>Computer games, learning and the curriculum: uneasy bedfellows?
