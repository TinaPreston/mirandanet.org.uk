In this spirit, at the BETT12 exhibition in London in January teachers and learners from other countries came together to find out about each other\u2019s schools and ways of working in order to gain new insights. The events was run by members of the <a href=\"https:\/\/wec.mirandanet.org.uk\/\">World Ecitizens<\/a> charity which was set up by teachers in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/\">MirandaNet Fellowship<\/a> to give a web voice to learners all over the world. Teachers and community leaders send all kinds of artefacts for publication, for example: peace posters from six year olds in England; Chinese theatre makeup from children in Beijing; and, concerns about pollution from Russia.\u00a0 When they publish each young learner receives a World Ecitizens certificate as an award for reaching out.

Ask me to prove it &#8211; that is another matter. It is obvious when watching any pupil who has been involved in an international project that their outlook has changed, their work ethic has improved, and that their motivation has increased. Putting all that into a form using quantitative data is a challenge.<\/p>\n<p>Use of ICT to connect pupils around the world has been and continues to be the way forward. In our increasingly global community we need to share what we have &#8211; shared work spaces on line enable pupils to work collaboratively \u00a0e.g. &#8211; Schools on line\u00a0Sub Saharan African project: See <a href=\"http:\/\/schoolsonline.britishcouncil.org\/node\/9744\">the link to our website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Zimbabwe, Nigeria and UK. UK teachers&#8217; visits to Zimbabwe and Nigeria made us aware of their lack of ICT infrastructure.\u00a0Our whole project is on sharing arts and crafts. The schools wanted to use ICT: the\u00a0Nigerian school was given a thin client set up room.\u00a0Zimbabwe has one laptop.\u00a0Everyone had flip videos.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest challenge continues to be teaching the staff the technology so that we could use flip videos and upload or post the videos to each other.<\/p>\n<h3>eTwinning project &#8211; Many Hands Make Light Work<\/h3>\n<p>This is a project on volunteering. It uses twinspace to upload the work we have done. It also has space for \u00a0pupils to &#8220;chat&#8221; about their work, and work together across the miles, collaboratively. \u00a0&#8211;<\/p>\n<p>my twinspace &#8211; if you want \u00a0to have a look at a live eTwinning Twinspace, follow the public link to my eTwinning project TwinSpace &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/new-twinspace.etwinning.net\/web\/p54276\">Many Hands Make Light Work<\/a>&#8220;:<\/p>\n<p>In other countries, the use of video conferencing is an excellent way of linking pupils. In my East Asian connecting Classrooms Project, the termly use of video conferences allowed pupils in 30 schools (10 in each of three countries) to work together. This is still going despite the official &#8220;end&#8221; of the project last July.
