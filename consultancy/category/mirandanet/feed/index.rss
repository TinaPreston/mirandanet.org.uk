										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>How TeachMeets and MirandaMods are one of the best and most cost-effective resources for teacher training, reflection and good practice.</strong></p>
<p>In the last five years I have been documenting the <a title="TeachMeet front page" href="http://teachmeet.pbworks.com/w/page/19975349/FrontPage" target="_blank">TeachMeet</a> and <a title="MirandaMods " href="http://mirandamod.wikispaces.com/Recent" target="_blank">MirandaMod</a> phenomenons on film.</p>
<p>I have now built up over 500 hours of film of teachers demonstrating, to other teachers, effective teaching and learning techniques.</p>
<p><strong>TEACHMEETS</strong></p>
<p><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="680" height="570" src="http://blip.tv/play/gr8cgqHqBQA" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></p>
<p>Each TeachMeet session consists of a number of teachers who have agreed to meet up (usually in the evening) and share best practice in either a seven or two minute presentation.</p>
<p>My role at each of these meets has been to live stream the video out for a wider audience much like a TV broadcast and to capture the sessions to film for free distribution later.</p>
<p>TeachMeets are extremely popular and growing in number. They are usually held in the evening towards the end of the school week or at weekends.</p>
<p><strong>COST EFFECTIVE CPD &#8211; IT&#8217;S POPULAR AND FREE!</strong></p>
<p>TeachMeets cost nothing for teachers or schools to put on, as all food, drink, accommodation and other publicity costs are increasingly paid for by commercial educational sponsors. The sponsors do not get to present but they do give out publicity matter and prizes for raffles. (e.g. a year&#8217;s free subscription to their services).</p>
<p>In many cases, as in the Blackpool Teachmeets last year, more teachers turned out for TeachMeet CPD than &#8220;official&#8221; scheduled LA CPD. This is increasingly becoming the norm &#8211; the main reasons for their popularity is that it that the CPD is coming from the teachers themselves and not the the LA advisers; the CPD is also a social event with food and drink and a chance to catch up with others on best practice. Teachers are often best placed to know more about current practice and innovative ways in which to reflect on and manage classroom teaching and learning so it is not surprising that this method of CPD has now caught on like wildfire.</p>
<p><strong>MIRANDAMODS</strong></p>
<p>I also film and archive MirandaMods which follow a similar pattern to TeachMeets except the films document longer and more reflective discussions.</p>
<p>People will discuss face to face and remotely the issues outlined in the MirandaMod sessions but also be able to amend documents in real time online as each session progresses.</p>
<p><strong>CPD IN HARD TO GET TO PLACES</strong></p>
<p>One of the main distinctions of MirandaMods over TeachMeets is that they are often broadcast from exhibitions or difficult to get to places for broadcast. I pride myself on being able to broadcast from almost anywhere in the country and with the most meagre of equipment. Last year I even managed to broadcast an educational discussion from a treehouse in the middle of Regents Park</p>
<p>Have a look at this broadcast from a table on a stand at the recent BETT show &#8211; the commercial partners, academics, teachers and others introduce themselves and the debate begins. Not only is the discussion going on face to face but also globally and all the notes and other exemplars are being gathered and sourced onto a collaboratively written document in real time saving hours of collating and dissemination.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The history of the founding of a professional organisation is often the key to the vision and practice of the members. For example, the consultants who work on MirandaNet projects in digital learning have first joined the MirandaNet community of practice, which is free, in a spirit of professional learning and sharing. Members are often first involved in voluntary work, and continue to contribute voluntarily to community activities between contracts. This attitude of professional commitment, that distinguishes this community, makes me proud to have been the founder and to be surrounded by so many colleagues who keep the vision alive.</p>
<p>But curious about the professional generosity of Fellows, colleagues often ask me why, as early as 1992, I founded the <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk">MirandaNet Fellowship</a> that has given rise to so many projects about learning with digital technologies around the world.</p>
<p>It was with the support of sympathetic colleagues, that I founded this international professional organisation in memory of our daughter, Corinna, to create a living memorial for a talented and bubbly sixteen year old with a tremendous sense of humour. She died suddenly of a virus.</p>
<p>I chose the name Miranda for our professional organisation because in the Shakespeare play, The Tempest, Miranda, the heroine, nearly says, “Oh brave new world that hath such people in IT”. My excuse for this slight rephrasing is that Shakespeare was a great multimodal communicator who simply did not have a computer to hand. The context is appropriate because Miranda is the daughter of Prospero who was a magician. When my daughter first was acquainted with computers she expressed the same sense of wonder &#8211; but quickly got down to practising coding so she was in control. She contributed graphics to Scoop, the first adventure game with pictures for 8 bit machines, that I authored with a group of teachers in 1987 not long before her death<a rel="attachment wp-att-227" href="http://www.mirandanet.org.uk/consultancy/2011/the-founding-of-mirandanet/slide2/"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-227 aligncenter" title="A Scoop location: buying software" src="http://www.mirandanet.org.uk/consultancy/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Slide2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/consultancy/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Slide2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/consultancy/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Slide2.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Despite the graphics in those early days the pupils still hand wrote their newspapers because desk top publishing was not widely available in schools.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-229" href="http://www.mirandanet.org.uk/consultancy/2011/the-founding-of-mirandanet/slide1/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-229" title="Slide1" src="http://www.mirandanet.org.uk/consultancy/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Slide1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/consultancy/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Slide1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/consultancy/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Slide1.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The MirandaNet Fellowship aims to unpick some of the workings of that digital magic so that educators can make greater use of opportunities that digital technologies offer. We have been involved in many projects since the early 1990s that have helped teachers to enriching learning for every student whatever their age or their aptitude. In particular we believe that digital technology can sometimes reach students who are not reaching their full potential in the traditional classroom.</p>
<p>MirandaNet, often known as the Facebook of ICT professionals in education, is a ‘community of practice’ (Wenger 1998). The members are drawn from international ICT policy makers, teachers, teacher educators, staff trainers, regional educators, commercial developers who are passionate about digital technology in teaching and learning and about using technologies to promote cultural understanding and democratic participation. This professional organisation is free to join and supported by the voluntary efforts of more than one thousand members from over fifty countries.</p>
<p>The composition of this community of practice reflects the mixed status of many professional groups that now assemble through the Internet. A growing number of members are taking post-graduate qualifications and are keen to share their knowledge with other members (Stuckey 2005). Commercial companies also support us by funding our practice-based research projects in order to learn from the knowledge building practices online and the research capacity of the members.</p>
<p>MirandaNetters publish peer-reviewed articles on the web in our ejournals. The generosity of the MirandaNetters in building a free knowledge base is typical of a new approach to copyright on the Web called the ‘Creative Commons’. This is a non-profit organisation that provides free tools so that authors, scientists, artists, and educators can easily mark their creative work with the freedoms they choose. The range stretches from “All Rights Reserved” to “Some Rights Reserved.” As a result, teachers have the freedom to publish their materials for each other without the mediation of a commercial editor and distributor. MirandaNet Members engage in many other kinds of knowledge creation activities that are underpinned by new modes of social interaction like wikis, blogs, ichat, listservs and unconferences. Miranda has also given her name to a particular kind of unconference, a MirandaMod, that allows members to engage with each other all over the world in real time. The last MirandaMod in real time had 25 contributors meeting in London and contributors coming in on the debate online from 20 countries. This kind of communication is unlike previous modes of knowledge construction because the members are not confined by meeting costs, location, work commitments or family responsibilities so long as they can access the Internet (Preston and Cuthell 2009 in press).</p>
<p>So first the contribution to my thinking of members of MirandaNet must be acknowledged: firstly MirandaNet collaborator, John Cuthell, who has worked in intellectual partnership with me over fifteen years on many joint papers and projects; Francis Howlett, MirandaNet web editor, who diligently keeps our website current; and, Anne Dobson who prepares the newsletter. I am also beholden to the Fellows who contribute to the life of the MirandaNet Fellowship especially: Allison Allen, Richard Allen, Miles Berry, Mara Chrystie, Alison Banks, Mark Bennison, Leon Cych, Margaret Danby, Anne Dobson, Jane Finch, Mary Harris, Theo Kuechel, Nigel Riley, Michael Smith, Katya Toneva, Dai Thomas, Keith Turvey, Alistair Wells &#8230; and Basia Korczak, called away at her most innovative and creative.</p>
<p>I must also thank the academic community who have supported me in this endeavour. In particular, Marilyn Leask who has partnered me in several projects over the last fifteen years as well as Ron Barnett, Sonia Blandford, Steve Coombs, Caroline Daly, Niki Davis, Bryn Holmes, Christina Howell Richardson, Gunther Kress, Carey Jewitt, Avril Loveless, Bozena Mannova, Di Mavers, Norbert Pachler, John Potter, Bridget Somekh, Leena Vainio and Sarah Younie. Thank you for stimulating my thinking in all kinds of different ways.</p>
<p>In the study I have uploaded on <a href="http://www.mirandanet.org.uk/etopia/">Etopia</a>, I relate my own learning journey to that of the community of practice Building Etopia here: I am hoping that many of my colleagues will use this as a template to develop their own digital learning histories for publication.</p>
