										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently came across a <a title="First Steps: Great Expectations of an English Teacher" href="http://mgiddins.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> by a Head of English in a school. It’s interesting to hear the views of a non-ICT specialist about what works or might work in getting teachers engaged. There are some very useful points made in the post entitled <a title="First Steps: Professional Development in Schools" href="http://mgiddins.wordpress.com/2010/06/15/professional-development-in-schools/" target="_blank">Professional Development in Schools</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Listening to staff after PD, their number one complaint is about not getting time to play and make stuff with what they just learned</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is absolutely correct in my experience. In fact, one of the most successful training sessions I ever ran was one where I allowed the teachers to spend three hours playing and experimenting, with myself and a technician on hand to give advice and guidance when asked. Teachers often think that they have to be doing and speaking all the time. You don’t.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure the project is based on something that can actually be used in the classroom (not just an excuse to try new tools) following a sound curriculum planning process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something which ought not need to be said, but it’s all too often the case that people fall into the trap of pursuing gadgets and widgets for their own sake. The key question to ask about <strong>anything</strong> in education is “So what?”. If you can’t answer that question truthfully and convincingly in terms of students learning outcomes, then why are you undertaking that activity?</p>
<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3422/3380005473_df0293cc99.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1278486498256" alt="" /></span></p>
<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span class="thumbnail-caption" style="width: 500px;">Are lunch and learns the answer?</span></span>Another idea is that of “Lunch and Learns”, taken from <a title="Lunch and Learns" href="http://biancahewes.wordpress.com/2010/05/22/%E2%80%98der-lunch-and-learns%E2%80%99-%E2%80%A6-hands-on-teacher-centred-professional-development/" target="_blank">Bianca Hewes’ blog</a>. The idea is that you run short lunchtime sessions which teachers may attend in order to refresh their knowledge of, or be introduced to, an application. I have to say that although I can see the attractiveness of this, I have an ambivalence towards it, for the following reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, I have come to the conclusion, rightly or wrongly, that the best thing to do at lunchtime is have lunch, followed by doing the crossword, chatting with friends, going for a walk or staring into space. I can’t see how working at lunchtime can be effective or even healthy – which is why for the past eight years I have eschewed breakfast meetings whenever possible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can see that lunch and learns are an attractive alternative to twilights and learns. Perhaps the important thing is to experiment and find out what appeals most to your colleagues.</p>
<p>The author of the blog, M Giddins, surprised me by saying that she avidly followed my <a title="31 Days to Become a Better Ed Tech Leader" href="http://www.ictineducation.org/home-page/tag/31-days">31 Days to Become a Better Ed Tech Leader</a> series &#8212; “surprised” because I’d written the series for ed tech leaders rather than other subject leaders, and it hadn’t occurred to me that others might find it useful. I put this to her, and she responded by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think now that any leader in education also falls into the role of educational technology leader in some ways. I have a faculty that need to be guided in their quest for technology integration and I need to be both the one who models, leads and inspires as well as the solver of the practical problems sometimes inherent in the integration of technology. Your series was very clear about the WHY behind the practical solutions that you offered, which made it possible to apply different solutions to suit my situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, there is a link to a <a title="Darcy's Cool Tools" href="http://go2.wordpress.com/?id=725X1342&amp;site=mgiddins.wordpress.com&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdarcymoore.net%2F2010%2F06%2F11%2Fcool-online-tools%2F&amp;sref=http%3A%2F%2Fmgiddins.wordpress.com%2F2010%2F06%2F15%2Fprofessional-development-in-schools%2F" target="_blank">list of tools</a> which is definitely worth exploring. The ones I know about already have a rightful place on the list, and I’m looking forward to exploring the others.</p>
<p>This précis of the article hardly does it justice, so do take the time to read <a title="Professional Development in Schools" href="http://mgiddins.wordpress.com/2010/06/15/professional-development-in-schools/" target="_blank">the original</a>, which is as inspiring as it is engagingly written.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>How TeachMeets and MirandaMods are one of the best and most cost-effective resources for teacher training, reflection and good practice.</strong></p>
<p>In the last five years I have been documenting the <a title="TeachMeet front page" href="http://teachmeet.pbworks.com/w/page/19975349/FrontPage" target="_blank">TeachMeet</a> and <a title="MirandaMods " href="http://mirandamod.wikispaces.com/Recent" target="_blank">MirandaMod</a> phenomenons on film.</p>
<p>I have now built up over 500 hours of film of teachers demonstrating, to other teachers, effective teaching and learning techniques.</p>
<p><strong>TEACHMEETS</strong></p>
<p><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="680" height="570" src="http://blip.tv/play/gr8cgqHqBQA" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></p>
<p>Each TeachMeet session consists of a number of teachers who have agreed to meet up (usually in the evening) and share best practice in either a seven or two minute presentation.</p>
<p>My role at each of these meets has been to live stream the video out for a wider audience much like a TV broadcast and to capture the sessions to film for free distribution later.</p>
<p>TeachMeets are extremely popular and growing in number. They are usually held in the evening towards the end of the school week or at weekends.</p>
<p><strong>COST EFFECTIVE CPD &#8211; IT&#8217;S POPULAR AND FREE!</strong></p>
<p>TeachMeets cost nothing for teachers or schools to put on, as all food, drink, accommodation and other publicity costs are increasingly paid for by commercial educational sponsors. The sponsors do not get to present but they do give out publicity matter and prizes for raffles. (e.g. a year&#8217;s free subscription to their services).</p>
<p>In many cases, as in the Blackpool Teachmeets last year, more teachers turned out for TeachMeet CPD than &#8220;official&#8221; scheduled LA CPD. This is increasingly becoming the norm &#8211; the main reasons for their popularity is that it that the CPD is coming from the teachers themselves and not the the LA advisers; the CPD is also a social event with food and drink and a chance to catch up with others on best practice. Teachers are often best placed to know more about current practice and innovative ways in which to reflect on and manage classroom teaching and learning so it is not surprising that this method of CPD has now caught on like wildfire.</p>
<p><strong>MIRANDAMODS</strong></p>
<p>I also film and archive MirandaMods which follow a similar pattern to TeachMeets except the films document longer and more reflective discussions.</p>
<p>People will discuss face to face and remotely the issues outlined in the MirandaMod sessions but also be able to amend documents in real time online as each session progresses.</p>
<p><strong>CPD IN HARD TO GET TO PLACES</strong></p>
<p>One of the main distinctions of MirandaMods over TeachMeets is that they are often broadcast from exhibitions or difficult to get to places for broadcast. I pride myself on being able to broadcast from almost anywhere in the country and with the most meagre of equipment. Last year I even managed to broadcast an educational discussion from a treehouse in the middle of Regents Park</p>
<p>Have a look at this broadcast from a table on a stand at the recent BETT show &#8211; the commercial partners, academics, teachers and others introduce themselves and the debate begins. Not only is the discussion going on face to face but also globally and all the notes and other exemplars are being gathered and sourced onto a collaboratively written document in real time saving hours of collating and dissemination.</p>
