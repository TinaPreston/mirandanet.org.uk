<h3><strong>Becoming a MirandaNet Associate</strong></h3>
<p>Since 1992 MirandaNet has worked in associateship with a range of small and medium companies as well as key multinationals in educational technologies. We like to involve our company associates in our events as equal partners in the exchange of information.  Face to face and online conferences and seminars provide a valuable showcase for products and services and research projects develop the relationships between developers and educators to mutual benefit.</p>
<p>Networking and dissemination opportunities can be as frequent as our associates wish as they have equal opportunities to plan the MirandaNet programmes and topics for  professional knowledge exchange. Our remit is wider in 2013/2014/2015 because we are also working with our partners in an EU project called HandsOn taking place in Greece, Slovenia, Spain and The Netherlands.</p>

<p>All our associates&#8217; logos will be on the leaflets, press releases and web spaces as well as  opportunities to speak at these events. Other kinds of sponsorship might be drinks receptions, conference bags, pull-ups and leaflet distribution.  We welcome copy in our quarterly newsletter and our associate companies are mentioned in Fellows&#8217; UK based and international speaking tours which in 2013/14 will be in Australia, Bulgaria, China, Czech Republic, New Zealand, Poland, Spain, Slovenia and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>MirandaNet consultants are keen to partner proposals that are underway and we offer partnerships in proposals we are planning. We also invite associates to join us when we are commissioned to do research, development and dissemination projects by  international government agencies and charities.</p>
<p>We have long associations with many of our associates and hold quarterly networking dinners. Some company colleagues have been awarded a MirandaNet Fellowship for the programmes they have designed with us and others follow other accredited programmes as part of the associateship.</p>

<p>The MirandaNet Fellowship is a portal to market with nearly 800 members in 80 countries. The website, the internal debating spaces and newsletter provide a cost effective marketing channel for targeting influencers and taste makers in schools as well as at local, national and international level. The membership includes teachers, senior managers, advisers, teacher educators, researchers and policy makers who are often account holders.  MirandaNet Fellows  have an influential voice at national level on issues concerning digital technologies and meet regularly with government Think Tanks and key members of government as well as important figures in the research field and teacher education, many of whom are members of MirandaNet. We are also well connected with influential national organisations in the use of digital technologies in education such as ITTE, Naace, ICTRN, BCS, IFIT, UNESCO and several University Special Interest Groups.</p>
<p>The website is well indexed and features prominently in Google searches. The site is well patronised and on average 1,300 pages are viewed each day. In detail, during 2012 the MirandaNet site had almost 68,000 unique visitors, with an average of 2 visits each, downloading slightly less than 7.5 pages per visit. In addition, web crawlers visited the site almost 1.8 million times, with an average of 13.5 hits per visit – which is one reason that MirandaNet appears high in most web searches of ICT, education, curriculum change and teacher CPD.</p>

<p>When Associates join us we tease out answers to questions our members and networks want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>What makes your product different and innovative? Why is it newsworthy?</li>
<li>What are the key outcomes/products/artefacts that can we refer people to?</li>
<li>When will the main products be available and what interim steps can be seen?</li>
<li>What are the key messages to disseminate to the teachers and mentors who we ask to pilot this?</li>
<li>What are the key messages to disseminate to the general audience?</li>
<li>What research can you refer to about your product?</li>
<li>Is the research robust? Can a MirandaNet study help you here?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we have agreed these answers we then work out the best ways to disseminate your message by reaching parts that others cannot reach! MirandaNet has access to educators&#8217; networks that are often closed or just unknown to companies.</p>
<p>Some of the channels we use are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video pills.</strong>  Videos by teachers about your product are a good idea as a medium for dissemination. In fact planning videos describing the project story boarding and a very clear idea of the key messages will be a good exercise. But it is very important to concentrate at this stage  on the messages for the whole project e.g. what is the product focus.You Tube might be a good for disseminating videos but you need high number of views in order to get them a profile. There are now other systems than Youtube which is blocked in most school in the UK.</li>
<li><strong>Blogs</strong> &#8211; Amongst the MirandaNet membership are some  bloggers are always needs contributions from ALL partners not just the UK. Need each partner&#8217;s project story, interests and expertise but needs to be in blog style not academic papers. In interesting blog would be  the reason for chosing the MOOC package once this decision is taken</li>
<li><strong>Mirandalink</strong> all associates have access to the MirandaNet internal debating listserv which is active and informative. Sometimes articles can be written from members reactions to debating questions.</li>
<li><strong>The newsletter</strong>. All Associates can supply at least three stores a year with links, promote offers and ask for educators to test their product</li>
<li><strong>Links to and from the MirandaNet website</strong>. Associates can have a page on our website where they introduce themselves or a page on their website to which Miranda can link.</li>
<li><strong>Networks</strong> &#8211; Associates are invited into networks of educators as the opportunities appear.</li>
<li><strong>Press releases and news stories</strong>&#8211; MirandaNet can publish press releases and news stories in various forms.</li>
<li><strong>Social networking</strong> &#8211; Miranda has a Face book presence and a Twitter feed</li>
<li><strong>Affinity marketing</strong> – we can advise associates on seeking similar projects or innovations that are complementary to Handson and use them as vectors for SUSTAINED dissemination. This relates back to WP6. A teacher professional  qualification in using ICT creatively to support their work would be a specific reason for teachers to participate and then disseminate what Handson is about through their networks.</li>
<li><strong>Journal articles and avertorials on other dissemination websites</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Professional development</strong></p>
<p><a href="../../../profdev/index.html">iCatalyst</a> is an innovative Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programme, developed by the <a href="../../../fellowship/index.html">MirandaNet Fellowship</a>, that is relevant to the whole workforce.</p>
<p>It is based on <a href="../../../publications/index.html">research</a> that MirandaNet Fellows have undertaken into CPD in digital technologies since 2004 and focuses on the educators taking ownership of change through action research and collaborative decision making.</p>
<p>This can be customised to give companies valuable feedback on their products or services. You can read more about the programme <a href="../professional-development-programmes/index.html">here. </a></p>
<h3><strong>Initiating research</strong></h3>
<p>Many companies over the years have asked MirandaNet Fellows to scope a research project that will help them learn more about their product and services as well as developing credibility in the market place. Web questionnaires carefully designed can provide businesses with relevant research data relating to the actual use of your products and services by practitioners. Focus groups and case studies can range from projects that take about 20 days to projects lasting a year or two and involving many teachers as co-researchers.We are happy to quote for budgets large and small.</p>
