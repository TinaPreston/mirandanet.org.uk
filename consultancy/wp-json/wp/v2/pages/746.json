In the programme leaders of the schools or school clusters are involved in the design and delivery of effective professional development.\u00a0 In the first place they work with iCatalyst consultants to identify what they want to gain from their investment in digital technologies in terms of evidence of learning. The leaders will then be involved in the collaborative development of an action research programme to collect evidence of learning in the classroom working with their colleagues. The outcomes will include: accreditation for the leaders of the programme; professional development for all the staff involved; local evidence of improved learning and other benefits to use in reports for Pupil Premium and Ofsted; case studies and articles for school publications; provides compelling evidence on which to base changes in practice; embeds knowledge about effective professional development as well as programme designers; global publication of the teachers&#8217; and the pupils&#8217; achievements. Inclusions in research reports published globally; about enriching classroom practice.<\/p>\n<h2>The programme<\/h2>\n<p>Since 1992 MirandaNet Fellows have been refining this strategic professional development programme where the professionals who participate identify the challenges they face and work collaboratively to find solutions. On this journey as co-researchers the participants build a professional community in order to amass the evidence they need to underpin the changes they want to make. In publishing their case studies on the MirandaNet website they reach out to other professionals who are making a similar journey in their workplace.<\/p>\n<p>This\u00a0 change management programme could be applied in a range of contexts and engage the whole workforce or just selected professionals\u00a0 like the potential community leaders. This way of working is particularly valuable in helping a group of professionals to reflect on changes that they wish to make to their policies and working practices and agree on how to implement the changes in order that they become embedded.<\/p>\n<p>The iCatalyst process differs from most traditional courses that finish with a writing task that is rarely shared with the other learners in the group. In an iCatalyst programme a community is developed where all the members assist each other in using the knowledge they have gained to improve their policies and work practices collaboratively.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0The programme is based on a large and varied body of research that MirandaNet Fellows have undertaken into the best ways to improve the motivation and retention of the workforce.<\/p>\n<h1><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The collaborative approach to learning<\/span><br \/><\/span><\/h1>\n<p>The programme is designed to achieve consensus amongst the participants about what needs to be changed, and more importantly, why and how. In this context participants in iCatalyst are often asked to draw individual and collaborative maps about their progress through the programme rather than write an essay. This map creation often results in more honesty about the challenges of professional learning and the emotional impact of embedding change that the iCatalyst programme aims to acknowledge.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1926 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide1.jpg\" alt=\"Slide1\" width=\"720\" height=\"498\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide1.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide1-300x207.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Above is one participant&#8217;s view at the beginning of the professional journey she has\u00a0 embarked on.

Elapa: Digital Technologies in South Africa<\/h2>\n<h3>Building a learning community in Free State province: 2001-2004<\/h3>\n<p>The digital technologies advisory team in the Free State province government of South Africa approached MirandaNet to help them to build ICT capacity in the region. One of the three poorest provinces in the country, Free State had no natural resources and, as a result, planned to imitate the growth of India by offering a workforce skilled in digital technologies at economic rates.<\/p>\n<p>To fulfill this aim Free State wanted help in developing a cross phase ICT professional development programme that could be adapted by the advisory team to the very different contexts and education levels that were to be found in the education institutions. Twelve schools in different contexts were chosen by the government to pair up with Twelve MirandaNet schools in England because at the core of the programme was professional exchange. The choice of educational establishments was made to ensure that the diversity of this new Rainbow nation was represented and that groups that had not worked together in the past now had this opportunity. A key issue was the diversity in the teacher training that had been available to the different groups in the past. Distance between all the schools involved was a problem and as a result an online environment was set up by the Free State government that was entered on the MirandaNet website &#8211; very new technology at that time.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide12.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1958\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide12.jpg\" alt=\"Slide1\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide12.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide12-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" \/><\/a>The professional learning community chose eLapa as their name because the Lapa is a place where African tribes meet to discuss important issues.

For many of the participants English was not their first language and as a result mapping their reactions at the beginning and end of the first phase was popular. They shared their maps and considered the implications of what they had learnt.\u00a0 Fanie had only just received her computer when the project started but her map traces remarkable progress by the end of the first stage.\u00a0<b> <\/b><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide13.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft  wp-image-1970\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide13-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Slide1\" width=\"297\" height=\"223\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide13-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide13.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft  wp-image-1971\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Slide2\" width=\"267\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide2-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide2.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" \/><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3>\u00a0<\/h3>\n<h3>\u00a0<\/h3>\n<h3>\u00a0<\/h3>\n<h3>\u00a0<\/h3>\n<h3>\u00a0<\/h3>\n<h3>\u00a0<\/h3>\n<h3>\u00a0<\/h3>\n<h3>In terms of results\u00a0 potential resources were created and tested by the eLapa community and an iCatalyst programme was developed from the pilot ready for the community leaders to work with more teachers from the other two thousand plus education institutions.<\/h3>\n<h3>In the opinion of the twelve Fellows who went out to South Africa they learnt as much as the teachers and pupils who came to England in the pursuit of an effective professional development programme in using digitally enhanced learning tools.<\/h3>\n<h3>At the end of the first stage, however, the Free State elections returns made an different political party, ANC, the new lead in the governent.\u00a0 As\u00a0 a result funding was not agreed by the new government for stage two and three, but many of the links between Fellows in Free State and England still remain.<\/h3>\n<h1>\u00a02. ICT tools for future teachers<\/h1>\n<p>In the thirty years since digital learning tools were introduced into schools, government has been supportive of the UK industry that has produced some outstanding products to improve teaching and learning.<\/p>\n<p>In 2009 Becta, the government agency for ICT, decided that they required research-based advice to support effective ICT use by teachers now and in the future. Christina Preston and Marilyn Leask, both members of the MirandaNet Fellowship, were asked to undertake this research that focused on five questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What in the views of practitioners, are the characteristics of effective technology-based tools and resources and how do they help teachers do their work well?<\/li>\n<li>What are the characteristics of effective non-technology based tools and resources and how to they help teachers do their work well?<\/li>\n<li>Where do practitioners go to find out about and access new tools for learning and teaching?<\/li>\n<li>What are the key challenges faced by practitioners in doing their job well?<\/li>\n<li>The future \u2013 what ICT tools would help? What digital solutions are needed? If these solutions do not exist, could they be created? What would their characteristics be, and how and when would they be used?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>iCatalyst methods<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Preston and Leask decided to use iCatalyst collaborative methods to ask expert practitioners to be co-researchers if they had\u00a0 experience of using these tools in the classroom.<\/p>\n<p>Initially 45 teachers from the nine government regions with expertise as senior managers and as classroom teachers in primary, secondary, special educational needs and FE as well as in local authorities and universities were worked together in focus groups over two days.Those attending were selected following an invitation via professional networks for nominations. Selection was made to get a balance across school types and roles and the ICT work being undertaken in their schools or institutions. Working as co-researchers and using mind mapping techniques they provided very detailed responses to the research questions.<\/p>\n<p>This collaborative process with the group is\u00a0 identified as second level analysis that is normally done by a researcher when they have collected all the data from interviews and questionnaires. This is the level at which the researcher aim to make sense of all the information, often on their own. In this case the expert group had shared all the basic data and were now analysing it collaboratively using a digital map.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/The-Future-Its-bright.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1996 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/The-Future-Its-bright.jpg\" alt=\"The Future - Its bright!\" width=\"2007\" height=\"905\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/The-Future-Its-bright.jpg 2007w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/The-Future-Its-bright-300x135.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/The-Future-Its-bright-1024x461.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2007px) 100vw, 2007px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>One of the six maps is shown above and another group&#8217;s larger map can be downloaded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Future-tools-p2.pdf\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The conversations in the focus groups were recorded additionally by a team member in each focus group. A grounded approach was then used to establish the key themes which provide the structure for the Supplementary Reports with data grouped progressively to create these themes as the work of the focus groups developed.<\/p>\n<p>To counter potential bias in the findings from what was a largely expert group, the findings were then tested through group and individual interviews with another fourteen teachers nominated by six institutions from the primary, secondary and FE sectors. International experts in ICT in Education from the US and Australia were also asked to comment on the draft findings. Both groups asked to scrutinize and challenge the initial findings in the light of their experience. In addition, a review of discussions on popular online forums like mirandalink where ICT tools are discussed was undertaken to identify what issues were preoccupying the teachers who use these forums.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Findings and recommendations<\/strong> <br \/>The Becta Harnessing Technology Strategy (2008) expressed the expectation that schools would make use of the pedagogical benefits of ICT tools. This ICT tools research showed that there was indeed by 2011 a widespread awareness of ICT tools as used now in everyday life and understanding that ICT could enable teachers to do their jobs well as well as improve the functioning of the institution.<\/p>\n<p>Although the report was published in 2011 the main findings and recommendations are still largely pertinent to education and industry today. For example, major barriers to improving the use of ICT tools and resources in school are: knowledge about the ways various technologies can be used to enhance teaching, learning and assessment is very patchy with deep knowledge scattered across the education system and therefore hard to access, and; there is huge variation in the quality and reliability of the technical infrastructure which teachers have to rely on to integrate ICT tools into daily practice.<\/p>\n<p>The five major recommendations we made on the basis of expert pracitioner input are now valuable as a discussion agenda in iCatalyst programmes as there is no longer a national lead organization to promote a central view in the UK about effective policy and practice.<\/p>\n<p>Detailed recommendations on curriculum, assessment practices, developing organisational and individual capacity, creating a national infrastructure to support sharing and change management strategies can be downloaded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Future-tools-p2.pdf\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1>3.\u00a0 Bohdi programme, India<\/h1>\n<p>The Podar charity who were expanding their schools into the rural areas of India,\u00a0 MirandaNet was invited to run a\u00a0 programme for forty principals who meet termly over two years from 2010-2012 to identify ways of improving teaching methods and sharing them with new staff.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide04.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1920 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide04.jpg\" alt=\"Slide04\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide04.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide04-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Firstly the staff celebrated what they were already doing well including their creative response to new ideas.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide05.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1916 \" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide05-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Slide05\" width=\"453\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide05-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Slide05.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" \/><\/a>In considering how to move forward they decided that they needed support from MirandaNet Fellows to strengthen the peripatetic advisory team were to be the leaders of a community of practice.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>They called their community, Bohdi, the tree of knowledge,\u00a0where principals and their staff could exchange policy and practice.

ICT tools for future teachers<\/h1>\n<p>In the thirty years since digital learning tools were introduced into schools, government has been supportive of the UK industry that has produced some outstanding products to improve teaching and learning.<\/p>\n<p>In 2009 Becta, the government agency for ICT, decided that they required research-based advice to support effective ICT use by teachers now and in the future. Christina Preston and Marilyn Leask, both members of the MirandaNet Fellowship, were asked to undertake this research that focused on five questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What in the views of practitioners, are the characteristics of effective technology-based tools and resources and how do they help teachers do their work well?<\/li>\n<li>What are the characteristics of effective non-technology based tools and resources and how to they help teachers do their work well?<\/li>\n<li>Where do practitioners go to find out about and access new tools for learning and teaching?<\/li>\n<li>What are the key challenges faced by practitioners in doing their job well?<\/li>\n<li>The future \u2013 what ICT tools would help? What digital solutions are needed? If these solutions do not exist, could they be created? What would their characteristics be, and how and when would they be used?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>iCatalyst methods<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Preston and Leask decided to use iCatalyst collaborative methods to ask expert practitioners to be co-researchers if they had\u00a0 experience of using these tools in the classroom.<\/p>\n<p>Initially 45 teachers from the nine government regions with expertise as senior managers and as classroom teachers in primary, secondary, special educational needs and FE as well as in local authorities and universities were worked together in focus groups over two days.Those attending were selected following an invitation via professional networks for nominations. Selection was made to get a balance across school types and roles and the ICT work being undertaken in their schools or institutions. Working as co-researchers and using mind mapping techniques they provided very detailed responses to the research questions.<\/p>\n<p>This collaborative process with the group is\u00a0 identified as second level analysis that is normally done by a researcher when they have collected all the data from interviews and questionnaires. This is the level at which the researcher aim to make sense of all the information, often on their own. In this case the expert group had shared all the basic data and were now analysing it collaboratively using a digital map.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/The-Future-Its-bright.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1996 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/The-Future-Its-bright.jpg\" alt=\"The Future - Its bright!\" width=\"2007\" height=\"905\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/The-Future-Its-bright.jpg 2007w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/The-Future-Its-bright-300x135.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/The-Future-Its-bright-1024x461.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2007px) 100vw, 2007px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>One of the six maps is shown above and another group&#8217;s larger map can be downloaded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Future-tools-p2.pdf\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The conversations in the focus groups were recorded additionally by a team member in each focus group. A grounded approach was then used to establish the key themes which provide the structure for the Supplementary Reports with data grouped progressively to create these themes as the work of the focus groups developed.<\/p>\n<p>To counter potential bias in the findings from what was a largely expert group, the findings were then tested through group and individual interviews with another fourteen teachers nominated by six institutions from the primary, secondary and FE sectors. International experts in ICT in Education from the US and Australia were also asked to comment on the draft findings. Both groups asked to scrutinize and challenge the initial findings in the light of their experience. In addition, a review of discussions on popular online forums like mirandalink where ICT tools are discussed was undertaken to identify what issues were preoccupying the teachers who use these forums.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Findings and recommendations<\/strong> <br \/>The Becta Harnessing Technology Strategy (2008) expressed the expectation that schools would make use of the pedagogical benefits of ICT tools. This ICT tools research showed that there was indeed by 2011 a widespread awareness of ICT tools as used now in everyday life and understanding that ICT could enable teachers to do their jobs well as well as improve the functioning of the institution.<\/p>\n<p>Although the report was published in 2011 the main findings and recommendations are still largely pertinent to education and industry today. For example, major barriers to improving the use of ICT tools and resources in school are: knowledge about the ways various technologies can be used to enhance teaching, learning and assessment is very patchy with deep knowledge scattered across the education system and therefore hard to access, and; there is huge variation in the quality and reliability of the technical infrastructure which teachers have to rely on to integrate ICT tools into daily practice.<\/p>\n<p>The five major recommendations we made on the basis of expert pracitioner input are now valuable as a discussion agenda in iCatalyst programmes as there is no longer a national lead organization to promote a central view in the UK about effective policy and practice.<\/p>\n<p>Detailed recommendations on curriculum, assessment practices, developing organisational and individual capacity, creating a national infrastructure to support sharing and change management strategies can be downloaded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/Future-tools-p2.pdf\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>More information<\/h2>\n<p>You can read more about the iCatalyst programme <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/joining-as-a-associate-20142015\/professional-development-programmes\/\">here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>MirandaNet case studies are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/casestudies\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Related MirandaNet research publications can be accessed from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/publications\/\">Publications<\/a> pages.<\/p>\n<h1>\u00a0Contact<\/h1>\n<p>MirandaNet consultants are always ready to work with schools, governments, companies and charities on their professional development requirements.<\/p>\n<p>Contact <a href=\"&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;l&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#101;n&#x71;&#x75;&#x69;&#114;i&#x65;&#x73;&#x40;&#109;i&#x72;&#x61;&#x6e;&#100;a&#x6e;&#x65;&#x74;&#46;a&#x63;&#x2e;&#x75;&#107;\">&#x65;&#110;q&#x75;&#x69;&#114;i&#x65;&#x73;&#64;m&#x69;&#x72;&#97;n&#x64;&#x61;&#110;e&#x74;&#46;&#97;c&#x2e;&#117;k<\/a> for details.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0 &nbsp; Summary iCatalyst is a bespoke, personalised professional development programme that focuses on strategies that support the leadership and the management of change.
