The website, the internal debating spaces and newsletter provide a cost effective marketing channel for targeting influencers and taste makers in schools as well as at local, national and international level. The membership includes teachers, senior managers, advisers, teacher educators, researchers and policy makers who are often account holders.\u00a0 MirandaNet Fellows \u00a0have an influential voice at national level on issues concerning digital technologies and meet regularly with government Think Tanks and key members of government as well as important figures in the research field and teacher education, many of whom are members of MirandaNet. We are also well connected with influential national organisations in the use of digital technologies in education such as ITTE, Naace, ICTRN, BCS, IFIT, UNESCO and several University Special Interest Groups.<\/p>\n<p>The website is well indexed and features prominently in Google searches. The site is well patronised and on average 1,300 pages are viewed each day. In detail, during 2012 the MirandaNet site had almost 68,000 unique visitors, with an average of 2 visits each, downloading slightly less than 7.5 pages per visit. In addition, web crawlers visited the site almost 1.8 million times, with an average of 13.5 hits per visit \u2013 which is one reason that MirandaNet appears high in most web searches of ICT, education, curriculum change and teacher CPD.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Marketing outlets<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_1231\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/Swanns.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1231\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1231 \" title=\"Swanns\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/Swanns-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/Swanns-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/Swanns-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/consultancy\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/Swanns.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-1231\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">University of Bedfordshire<\/p><\/div>\n<p>When Associates join us we tease out answers to questions our members and networks want to know:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What makes your product different and innovative?

Can a MirandaNet study help you here?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once we have agreed these answers we then work out the best ways to disseminate your message by reaching parts that others cannot reach! MirandaNet has access to educators&#8217; networks that are often closed or just unknown to companies.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the channels we use are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Video pills.<\/strong> \u00a0Videos by teachers about your product are a good idea as a medium for dissemination. In fact planning videos describing the project story boarding and a very clear idea of the key messages will be a good exercise.\u00a0But it is very important to concentrate at this stage \u00a0on the messages for the whole project e.g. what is the product focus.You Tube might be a good for disseminating videos but you need high number of views in order to get them a profile. There are now other systems than Youtube which is blocked in most school in the UK.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Blogs<\/strong> &#8211; Amongst the MirandaNet membership are some\u00a0 bloggers are always needs contributions from ALL partners not just the UK.
