By adding the ability to then drag and drop resources onto the timetable, teachers can create assignments and activities for students. Teachers can create a sophisticated Page to support learning through the delivery of resources, such as web links, blogs and wikis and a range of other interactive widgets that can simply be dragged onto a class dashboard.<\/p>\n<p>Tim Morton, the Network Administrator at the RSA Academy in the UK says he chose Aspen because it is more than a MIS, \u201cAt the moment the fact that you\u2019ve got your MIS and learning platform wrapped up into one product. Also that you can mould the products to do anything you want to do. So anyone that\u2019s excited about educating their students and want to think differently should consider Aspen as an MIS system.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Explore what we do on our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.follettsoftware.com\/school-administration-software\">website.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Group Call<\/h2>\n<p>Groupcall who arranged the MirandaNet interview with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\">Sir Bob Geldof <\/a>supply Apps, communication software and data extraction tools to the Education, Public, and Business sectors.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.groupcall.com\">Group Call<\/a> have submitted some interesting case studies:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/articles\/spring-newsletter\/associates-news\/central-bedfordshire-council\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4184\">Central Bedfordshire Council<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/articles\/spring-newsletter\/associates-news\/stoke-dameral-emerge\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4182\">Stoke Dameral &#8211; Emerge<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/articles\/spring-newsletter\/associates-news\/warriner-231210\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4183\">Warriner <\/a><\/p>\n<h2>LightSpeed<\/h2>\n<p>Roger Turner, LightSpeed, has brought a new clarity to MirandaMods with their sounds systems. The research about children who simply cannot hear most of what is happening in the classroom is compelling. Once you read the findings it is hard to understand why more is not made of this.<\/p>\n<p>Like many of our associates, Roger has had many roles in education as a music teacher, senior lecturer in music education, local authority advisor, chief inspector and assistant director of education. As he explains,<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In all that time I remained unaware of the critical importance of ensuring excellent speech intelligibility for all students. Since becoming an education consultant and researcher for Lightspeed Technologies, a major developer and manufacturer of classroom audio distribution (CAD) systems, I have come to understand the serious disadvantage students and teachers experience when working in classrooms with unsatisfactory acoustics.<br \/> CAD systems spread the voice of the teacher evenly around a classroom at a level (+15-20db) to overcome the problems of excessive reverberation and internal and external noise polution. Students need a considerably stronger signal than adults if they are to hear, understand and remember what is being said as they do not have the fully developed cognitive skills or vocabulary to &#8216;fill in the gaps&#8217; when they fail to hear words. My own research has resulted in my understanding the many benefits acrrued from the installation of CAD technology.<\/p>\n<p>My reason for wishing to be a member of MirandaNet is to be part of a community passionate about investigating, understanding and disseminating the benefits technology can bring to education&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Members can all have access to this equipment to try it out. I have been amazed at the difference these inobstrusive mics make to my hearing.
