This provides a broad and targeted outreach for research findings.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Events, conferences and unconferences<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>MirandaMods<\/strong><br \/> Companies are invited to participate in the programme of events and conference run by MirandaNet each year. One distinctive model where a company representative can join in debates with educators is the MirandaMod. This is an informal, loosely structured unconference of like-minded educators who share ideas about the use of technology to inspire others. The MirandMod is often a\u00a0 fringe event following or attached to a formal MirandaNet seminar\/workshop or meeting. There is often\u00a0 an International dimension to this event when as many as forty members join on line.\u00a0 A transcript of the meeting is published as well as a collaborative digital map that is authored by the participants and provides a resource of the latest information on the subject in hand. Resources can be found under <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/mirandamods\/\">MirandaMods<\/a>. Recent MirandaMods have been held at the BETT show, the Education Show, CAL11 and at a technologies conference at Korinthos in Greece. MirandaMods\u00a0 can be held to explore the value of a range of technologies, their impact in the classroom and the theories about teaching and learning that are generated by their use.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Innovative formats for research findings<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some research is just published as a report and an article is sent to appropriate publications.
