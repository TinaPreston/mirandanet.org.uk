A political attack on academics and teachers in the UK<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Educators and academics may not have the longevity of the British Queen, but nevertheless professionals in education have more longevity than governments and, therefore, are likely to have more knowledge about education than merely having attended a school in their youth. In the century of the internet, we now have evidence that professionals should not be dependent on political favour to maintain repositories of research findings and resources that, in the long terms can have global impact on educational achievement.<\/p>\n<p>In this context, Professors Marilyn Leask\u00a0 and Christina Preston have just returned from a speaking tour of Australia and New Zealand universities building up support for <em>Re-engineering the profession: call for collective action.<\/em> Underlying this initiative is a concern about recent attacks on academics and their respositories of knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>MirandaNet has been involved recently in the consultations about the ICT curriculum which the Coalition government are threatening to change to two thirds coding without the agreement of the main professional bodies: ITTE, Naace and MirandaNet.<\/p>\n<p>The attempts to by-pass professional opinion about the ICT curriculum is one aspect of an more wide reaching attack on academics and teachers that the Coalition has mounted. In one attack, Micheal Gove, the UK Secretary of State for Education, and ex-journalist, is clearly not expecting to win teachers&#8217; votes with his polemic published in the Mail on Sunday, a right wing tabloid:<\/p>\n<p><em>I refuse to surrender to the Marxist teachers hell-bent on destroying our schools: Education Secretary berates &#8216;the new enemies of promise&#8217; for opposing his plans.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Next we have the Chief Inspector of OFSTED, Michael Wilshaw&#8217;s comments about the letter, signed by 100 UCET academics, criticising his reforms. Apart from the fact that the Chief Inspector should be impartial, Michael Wilshaw shows a lack of understanding of teacher educators\u2019 partnerships with schools by calling on them to come out of their \u2018ivory towers\u2019. This is a strange attack on academics from an ex-head teacher who thought that the most important achievement of the school he ran in a disadvantaged London community was that a few pupils won places at Oxbridge. He says all pupils should aspire to this level of academic excellence and yet criticises academics if they do not agree with his approach. Isn&#8217;t the point of creating academics an effort\u00a0 to create more intelligent thinkers in a democracy?<\/p>\n<p>Firstly the way in which the new ICT curriculum has been designed in England is a concern in terms of wider issues about the preservation of democracy processes and regard for professionalism. For example, government websites holding many years of resources and research developed by professionals have been closed down by the Coalition. For example, Becta, the government agency for digital technologies in education, funded a huge variety of publications developed by teachers and teacher educators. These publications can no longer be accessed as in 2010 when they were elected, the Coalition closed all the government websites including Becta\u2019s research and professional development publications, the Teacher Training Agency ICT resource bank for teachers and Teachers\u2019 TV. A huge repository of resources, advice and evidence has been destroyed.<\/p>\n<p>But developing collaborative strategies for building knowledge has also resulted in strategies for influencing government policy by strengthening professional judgment with \u2018crowd sourced\u2019 evidence. So far teachers and academics have not been good at publishing evidence in a single place as doctors have. \u00a0The successful model used in the medical field, The Cochrane review, already adopts the ideas of knowledge management to the managing and building of knowledge which is scaled up by the submission of small scale studies that are analysed to achieve a wider consensus on what works and what does not work. The intention is that learner attainment will be raised by professionalizing teaching.<\/p>\n<p>Independent global ownership by universities of the platform means that the teaching profession and the associated academics do not have to trust the continued funding of government websites when the political regimes change drastically and education becomes a political football. From this starting point an international community of communities has been established, the Education Futures Collaboration, based at the University of Bedfordshire. This independent organisation is for global educators, teachers and academics as well as companies,\u00a0 who wish to work collaboratively to improve the quality of education and make sure that knowledge is disseminated. The ideas, values and work strands underpinning the Education Futures Collaboration have been evolving for many years through the professional interests and work of a number of founding members. The Royal Academy of Engineers, the British Computer Society and teachers from Computers in Schools who have been advising the Coalition are also be invited to add pathways from their research and knowledge about Computing Science.<\/p>\n<p>Read more about Miranda&#8217;s involvement in the Education Futures Collaboration here.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/debate\/article-2298146\/I-refuse-surrender-Marxist-teachers-hell-bent-destroying-schools-Education-Secretary-berates-new-enemies-promise-opposing-plans.html#ixzz2PD3mT9xh \">Read more<\/a> about the Gove article.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/tto\/education\/article3718769.ece\">Read more <\/a>about the Wilshaw article.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">3.

The reason is that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/keynotes-and-papers\/\">in his address<\/a> to BETT12 in January, Michael Gove set up <a href=\"http:\/\/www.education.gov.uk\/schools\/teachingandlearning\/curriculum\/nationalcurriculum\/a00202110\/ict-curriculum-consultation\">the consultation<\/a> about the disapplication of the ICT curriculum. If disapplication goes through in September it will mean that heads no longer have to be accountable to Ofsted for the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning in their schools. Some heads are already taking advantage of the apparent lack of political support to economise on ICT provision. The danger is that if a new ICT curriculum is agreed there will be few staff trainers, advisers and commercial providers left to deliver it.
