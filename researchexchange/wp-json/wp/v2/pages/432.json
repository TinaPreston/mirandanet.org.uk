As a result from 1999-2003 \u00a0the first national programme was undertaken, designed to give all teachers a grounding in appropriate pedagogies for the use \u00a0digital technologies in the classroom.<\/p>\n<p>This keynote will concentrate on the findings from the extensive body of research that has emerged since 1999 on the value and effectiveness of a range of\u00a0 Continuing Professional Development(CPD) models for teachers.<\/p>\n<p>The questions that will be raised in the keynote are:<\/p>\n<p>Does the effective use of digital technologies in education\u00a0 depend on a teacher\u2019s computer skills alone, or on those skills developed in context?<\/p>\n<p>Should CPD in digital technologies simply reflect the learning culture of the teacher and the currrent teaching methods or aim to change the learning and teaching culture culture ?<\/p>\n<p>Which CPD model will best suit Argentinian teachers? How can the effectiveness of a CPD model be evaluated against desired learning outcomes?<\/p>\n<p>Is there a place for informal learning about digital technologies for teachers and pupils in communities of practice where their own expertise is valued and knowledge is shared? Can social networking, underpinning the work of communities of practice, support the right to Quality Education for All?\u201d How can the balance between digital literacy and digital safety be maintained when powerful new social media are promoted in schools and in teacher education?<\/p>\n<p>Why are some teachers more reluctant to use digital technologies than others?<\/p>\n<p>What are the digital tools that teachers want in the future?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Key references<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Daly, C, N.
