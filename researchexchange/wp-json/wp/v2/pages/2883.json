Instead, ministers will offer scholarships worth \u00a320,000 to attract high-achieving graduates to train as computer science teachers. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/education\/2012\/oct\/19\/computer-science-lessons-facebook-update\">Read more&#8230;<\/a><\/p>\n<p>MirandaNet Members\u00a0 comments are welcome on &#109;&#x69;&#114;&#x61;n&#x64;a&#108;&#x69;&#110;&#x6b;&#64;&#x6d;i&#114;&#x61;&#110;&#x64;a&#x6e;e&#116;&#x2e;&#97;&#x63;&#46;&#x75;k\u00a0 where other members can see this.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mark Harrison, Director of the Royal Academy of Engineering, has sent a link to the\u00a0 ICT Programme of study which has just been published.
