I have found this essential reading alongside my involvement in the pilot of the EU LLL HandsOn ICT MOOC. Yishay Mor has designed this MOOC as a learner-centred activity, a notion that is widely and deeply examined in the text. The combination of these two learning activities has made me far more optimistic and confident that technologies used well can enrich learning and teaching processes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/publications\/book-reviews\/6148-2\/\"><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Read More<\/span><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>A Call to Action<\/strong><\/h3>\n<h3><strong>Teaching with Technologies: the Essential Guide<\/strong><\/h3>\n<h3>Marilyn Leask and Sarah Younie<\/h3>\n<p>Between them over the last three decades, authors, Leask and Younie, have held posts in schools, universities, national agencies and local government in England as teachers, senior managers, teacher educators, government project managers and researchers. As a result they bring a variety of perspectives to the subject of teaching with technology. Based on the broad knowledge and experience they have accumulated, they identify and record the essentials of theory, practice and research that an educator will require to practice well in the networked and personalised age that is now emerging in the twenty first century. <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/publications\/book-reviews\/6011-2\/\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Read more<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Narrative Ecologies: Teachers as Pedagogical Toolmakers<\/strong><\/h3>\n<h3>Keith Turvey<\/h3>\n<p>Books are an excellent technology to use on trains and buses where wifi and seats are intermittent.
