We are\u00a0 leaving time for networking and &#8216;drop in&#8217; demos so please keep to your allotted time and network informally with those who want to ask questions afterwards.<\/p>\n<p>There is a MirandaMod unconference in which everyone is welcome to participate from 1630 &#8211; 1730 on 30th, 31st January and 1st February . At 1800 those who stay will be welcome to gather together for supper at a restaurant nearby: cost about \u00a310-20.<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday the formula will be different as all the participants will be educators exchanging curriculum ideas and we have a packed programme of shorter discussions. At the end we have a Think Tank where we are looking for digital solutions to raising achievement and improving behaviour.\u00a0 Do you have the answers?<\/p>\n<p>MirandaNet members and friends will also be welcome to join us for an early supper after the Saturday show at about 1630 (about \u00a310-20).
