As a result they bring a variety of perspectives to the subject of teaching with technology. Based on the broad knowledge and experience they have accumulated, they identify and record the essentials of theory, practice and research that an educator will require to practice well in the networked and personalised age that is now emerging in the twenty first century. <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/publications\/book-reviews\/6011-2\/\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Read more<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Practical Design Patterns for Teaching and Learning with Technology<\/h2>\n<h4>Yishay Mor, Harvey Mellar, Steven Warburton and Niall Winters (Eds)<\/h4>\n<p>This fascinating book provides plenty of evidence that \u2018these are challenging times in which to be an educator.\u2019 I\u2019d recommend it to anyone who is grappling with the value of new technologies whatever their teaching and learning style. I have found this essential reading alongside my involvement in the pilot of the EU LLL HandsOn ICT MOOC. Yishay Mor has designed this MOOC as a learner-centred activity, a notion that is widely and deeply examined in the text. The combination of these two learning activities has made me far more optimistic and confident that technologies used well can enrich learning and teaching processes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/publications\/book-reviews\/6148-2\/\"><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Read More<\/span><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Narrative Ecologies: Teachers as Pedagogical Toolmakers<\/h2>\n<h3>Keith Turvey<\/h3>\n<p>Books are an excellent technology to use on trains and buses where wifi and seats are intermittent. So for the last thirty years I have reviewed erudite books and journal papers about digital technologies on my journeys from home to London and back.
