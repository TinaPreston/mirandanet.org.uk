Vast sums were spent on new computer labs, interactive whiteboards, wireless networks and laptops. In many cases this has had great effects on attendance and behaviour monitoring, but the evidence that it has led to sustained improvements in learning outcomes is thin.<\/p>\n<p>The current pressures on school budgets now require a new approach. A suggestion of improved learning is no longer sufficient grounds to spend money unless it can be shown that there are no cheaper interventions that have similar or larger positive effects on attainment.<\/p>\n<p>In order to buy with confidence school leaders should explicitly link technology purchases to learning needs, and to ensure that a major portion of any budget is set aside for implementation (i.e. training and support) and on-going evaluation.<\/p>\n<p>The key questions to ask are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the specific pupil learning need that we are trying to address with this purchase? Is there a cheaper or easier way to address it (e.g. working on more effective feedback and questioning or using existing technology more effectively)<\/li>\n<li>Will this technology supplement and support the teaching methods that teachers are already comfortable with, or will it require significant and expensive changes in teaching habits, schemes of work and resources?<\/li>\n<li>What is the risk that this technology becomes unreliable and impedes teaching and learning? What level of technical support, back-up and redundancy (i.e. spares) is needed to prevent this and how can this be maintained over future years?<\/li>\n<li>How will teachers embed the use of this new technology in to their schemes of work and lesson plans? Who are the experts in how to do this effectively and are they readily accessible? Will teachers be given dedicated, regular times to work together to evaluate and refine their approach to using the technology?<\/li>\n<li>Will the technology allow us to address multiple learning needs, is it flexible, upgradable and extendable?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>No school is short of good ideas or enthusiastic suggestions and it is the tough job of a leader to try and whittle these down to a few high-impact and reliable projects.\u00a0 It is significantly more effective to have one or two technology projects with significant two-to-three year training and support programmes built in than have several smaller projects and risk having cupboards full of under-used, redundant and\/or broken equipment.<\/p>\n<p>Staff training and learning is possibly the most important element of any technology project, and yet it often ends up at the bottom of the priority list. Here are some dos and don\u2019ts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Do<\/em> plan regular (at least twice per half-term) protected meeting times where teachers who use the technology can collaboratively review their use of it as well as the evidence on how it is affecting pupil learning. They should then plan lessons and create resources to support improvements in the next cycle, with support from an expert where possible.<\/li>\n<li><em>Don\u2019t<\/em> simply send teachers on one-off courses without having a sustained programme of support and collaboration back at school. These courses work very well as expert input to larger processes, but less well in creating sustained improvements by themselves.<\/li>\n<li><em>Do <\/em>regularly (at least termly) evaluate how well the technology is being used, technical support needs, how pupils are being engaged, how learning is being improved, the confidence levels of teachers and further training needs. Feed the information in to the collaborative planning process and reserve some budget to act on issues that arise.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>David Weston is the Chief Executive of the <a href=\"http:\/\/TeacherDevelopmentTrust.org\/\">Teacher Development Trust<\/a>.

Digital Literacy, Computing, and ICT. While there has been a great deal of consensus about the need for change, there are still a wide range of valid differences of opinion. Does digital literacy mean the same thing to all? Is computing, programming or something more related to the mathematics of computation? Is ICT simply using to-day&#8217;s technology to aid learning or is it about the transferable knowledge and skills needed to change working practices as the technology changes without needing formal retraining? Are the three strands discrete or is the reality more a mix that is dependent on context? The Mirandanet approach has been to try to arrive at an appropriate balance within the constraints of the current political consensus. It is essentially based on the extensive practical experience of teaching children in the national curriculum age range, tempered with research evidence and the needs of employers.<\/p>\n<p>About me<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Ian-Lynch.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3808\" title=\"Ian Lynch\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Ian-Lynch.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"96\" height=\"96\" \/><\/a>Teacher in 4 Local Authorities an independent school and a CTC<\/p>\n<p>Member of senior management responsible for science and technology setting up the first City Technology College in the UK<\/p>\n<p>Curriculum Director Science and Mathematics CTC Trust<\/p>\n<p>Registered Inspector of schools accredited by Office for Standards in Education<\/p>\n<p>Assessor of the National Professional Qualification for Headteachers<\/p>\n<p>Founded IRIS, the Professional Association for Registered Inspectors<\/p>\n<p>Founded IRL Computer Systems Ltd, ZMS Ltd and The Learning Machine Ltd<\/p>\n<p>Member of the Management Committee for Apache OpenOffice and a committer at the Apache Software Foundation<\/p>\n<p>Provided consultancy to a range of hi-tec companies including Acorn Computers, Psion Plc, Hitachi Software Engineering, Sun Microsystems.<\/p>\n<p>Written successful applications for 3 multilateral EU Transfer of Innovation projects with partners in BG, CZ, DE, NL, ES, RO.<\/p>\n<p>Achieved accreditation of TLM with Ofqual and acceptance of TLM Level 2 Certificate for IT Users for headline league table points.<\/p>\n<p>Founder contributor to the Modern Baccalaureate Foundation.<\/p>\n<p>Specialties: Business start ups, understanding global technological change, understanding education change and management of change, understanding business growth and how innovation can spread, business planning and financial control.

During the last years the range of ICT tools available in schools has risen very fast. From the perspective of our university their are two different stands we need\u00a0to follow:<\/p>\n<p>1.) We urgently need to reform and adapt our education for our student teachers. Our aim must be the best possible preparation for the school, and this includes not just knowledge about the different tools but also\u00a0some experience and the ability to decide which tool is appropriate at what time. Also teachers from schools express their expectation that young teachers from university bring &#8220;fresh air&#8221; and are able to deal with IWB and other tools. During my talk I&#8217;d like to present our approach and a reflection of our journey during the last three years, including the experiences and problems we&#8217;re facing.<\/p>\n<p>2.) On the other hand we need to ensure that we set up help for our in-service teachers. As policy in Saxony didn&#8217;t learn from the big roll-out of IWB in the UK there is an incredible need for training if they should not end as a wasted technique. Because of this a physics-specific two day teacher training session was developed and conducted regarding the experiences and advice from English studies. In contrast to other training we had the possibility to observe these lessons and analyse if it was really successful and made a difference. First results will be presented at the presentation.<\/p>\n<p>During the last three years we have made a big step forward but there is still a long way to go. I&#8217;m looking forward to sharing experiences with the audience to improve our approach, and to get inspired.<\/p>\n<p>View <a href=\"http:\/\/prezi.com\/2nqmy7bk3wkn\/bett-2013-mirandamod\/\">David&#8217;s Prezi<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Read\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p2Tth6-4p\">David Obst&#8217; BETT Blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">How\u00a0\u00a0might\u00a0ICT\/digital technologies be used to motivate and facilitate the inclusion of students from diverse backgrounds and disadvantage?<\/h2>\n<h2>Using technology to differentiate instruction and address specific learning needs<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Katya Toneva<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><\/strong>\u00a0Technology can motivate and facilitate the inclusion of students from diverse backgrounds and disadvantage in unlimited ways through content input, learning activities, enhanced interaction and feedback, and opportunities to demonstrate comprehension. In these processes, it is important to use inclusive technologies and make learning materials accessible to all students regardless of technological competence, confidence or disability.\u00a0 In the world of fast moving and evolving digital technologies, the instructional practices that make use of them are countless. This presentation will focus on the needs and solutions for students with reading disabilities and students who learn differently because of their linguistic backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">Before discussing specific technologies that can support teachers\u2019 inclusive practices, we will consider how to effectively integrate technology into instruction. We have adopted the slogan \u201cIt is not about technology, it is about how well we use it\u201d \u2013 teachers need to keep their focus on the learning outcomes, not on the technology itself. For example, teachers could support student with dyslexia who might normally struggle with their reading offering them to listen an audio recording through headphones. By providing audio, visual, or concept-mapping support available in class and online, teachers could extend students\u2019 learning time without extending their work hours.<\/p>\n<p>In this presentation, we will share a few examples of using suitable technologies and resources that can support students with learning difficulties. We will also explore tools for English language learners, who could benefit from the opportunity to hear and view the text simultaneously. We will show how to make use of free software, as well as basic technologies that can be found in almost every classroom.<\/p>\n<p>Dr Katya Toneva<br \/>\nMirandaNet Senior Researcher (E-learning)<\/p>\n<p><strong>1415 \u2013 1445<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>How can partnership with colleagues abroad help teaching and learning?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Led by Dan Bowen and Dave Smith<\/p>\n<p>Dan is a teaching and learning advisor in Surrey and the South East.
