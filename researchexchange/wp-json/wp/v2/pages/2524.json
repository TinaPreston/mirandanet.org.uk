It is clear that there is considerable potential for existing resources in the education system to be used more effectively. The Education Futures Collaboration addresses these issues.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The international context<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8230;.in many countries, education is still far from being a knowledge industry in the sense that its own practices are not yet being transformed by knowledge about the efficacy of those practices. OECD 2009 p.3<\/p>\n<p>Improving education systems is an elusive goal. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2009, p.3) calls for the transformation of \u201ctraditional models of schooling &#8230; into customised learning systems that identify and develop the talents of all students\u201d and; the \u201ccreation of \u2018knowledge-rich\u2019, evidence-based education systems, in which school leaders and teachers act as a professional community with the authority to act, the necessary information to do so wisely, and the access to effective support systems to assist them in implementing change&#8230;.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Educational Futures Collaboration goal is to harnesses the energies and knowledge of educators \u00a0worldwide to address these issues.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Aims<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Join up the pockets of excellence in teaching and evidence based practice<\/li>\n<li>Improve the quality of teaching and student attainment by creating knowledge rich educators<\/li>\n<li>Create a joined up profession, linking educators regardless of location<\/li>\n<li>Provide diagnosis and intervention tools to help educators and learners break through barriers in student learning, and the teaching and learning of particular concepts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Activities<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Education Futures Collaboration provides an e-infrastructure, the online Education Communities (www.educationcommunities.org) which both connects together educators and their partners working in isolated initiatives and creates national and international development capacity, allowing for knowledge exchange and co-creation between educators, teacher educators, policy-makers and academics nationally and internationally. \u00a0This is based on the successful equivalent created for local government in the UK.\u00a0 The diagram below and the text which follows outline the core strands of work.<\/p>\n<p>Core strands of work are:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.educationcommunities.org\/welcome.do\"><strong>Online Education Communities<\/strong><\/a><strong> <\/strong>(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.educationcommunities.org\/\">www.educationcommunities.org<\/a>)<br \/>\nProvision of an e-infrastructure providing online workspaces or communities to support global partnerships, co-research and collaborative networks for innovative educators, engaged in improving the quality of education in every context. New community work spaces can be quickly set up to respond to needs of members. Membership is open to all with the ability to create private communities.

The MESH approach uses multimedia mindmaps, as a way of presenting complex knowledge, each node providing a link to an annotatable display of more in-depth fully referenced knowledge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RaDaR<\/strong><br \/>\nThe educator<strong> Research &amp; Development &amp; Review<\/strong> (RaDaR) groups are networks of teacher researchers and academics who review and report on existing evidence and undertake collaborative research where evidence is needed. The outputs of these groups create pathways for MESH and evidence for the knowledge repositories. This approach builds on and extends innovative work happening across the sector e.g .Professor Colleen McLaughlin\u2019s work with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.educ.cam.ac.uk\/research\/projects\/super\/\">Schools- University Partnership <\/a>at the University of Cambridge and Dr Ian Terrell\u2019s work with schools across north west London through <a href=\"http:\/\/mdxpartnership.org.uk\/\">MidWheb<\/a> which grew out of teacher-researcher models for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.educationcommunities.org\/c\/120856\/doclib\/document-display.do?backlink=ref&amp;id=137061\">evaluation of the Technical Vocational Education Initiative in Enfield.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Quality Assurance<\/strong><br \/>\nQuality of resources is assured through the operation of peer review and independent judge processes. The use of e-survey tools enables rapid responses from a broad stratified sample of respondents to issues of the day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Associated Activities<\/strong><br \/>\nA variety of associated organisations are running activities which dovetail with this work on effective knowledge management and professional networking. A number of these take forward projects initially funded by what was the Training and Development Agency for schools (TDA) or the Higher Education Academy.

University of London, MirandaNet, Core Education. Staff from a wide range of universities and schools are already involved in the activities. An analysis of users of the Education Communities platform from the two year pilot stage shows engagement of over 800 educators from over 140 UK schools, universities and colleges; over 70 universities outside of the UK, over 110 UK charities, companies and education consultancies. There has been through word of mouth during the pilot phase. \u00a0As with the local government online communities of practice, some public servants in central government organisations also use the online community way of working to work with their contacts in the field.<\/p>\n<p>More on MirandaNet, MESH and Education Communities <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/about-the-team\/government-briefing\/education-communities\/\">here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong><\/strong>For more details about registering a\u00a0 MESH pathway email &#99;&#x68;&#x72;i&#115;&#x74;i&#110;&#x61;&#64;&#109;&#x69;r&#97;&#x6e;&#x64;&#97;&#x6e;&#x65;t&#46;&#x61;c&#46;&#x75;k<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reference<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>OECD (2009) Creating Effective Teaching and Learning Environments: First Results from Teaching and Learning international Survey (TALIS) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oecd.org\/document\/54\/0,3343,en_2649_39263231_42980662_1_1_1_1,00.html\">http:\/\/www.oecd.org\/document\/54\/0,3343,en_2649_39263231_42980662_1_1_1_1,00.html<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Education Futures Collaboration\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.edfuturescollaboration.org\/\">www.edfuturescollaboration.org<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Goverment Briefing paper Prepared by Marilyn Leask, Professor of Educational Knowledge Management Education Futures Collaboration supporting professional judgement with evidence raising pupil attainment by professionalizing teaching The Education Futures Collaboration is an independent umbrella organisation for educators and their partners &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/about-the-team\/government-briefing\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":533,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2524"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2524"}],"version-history":[{"count":10,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2524\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2526,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2524\/revisions\/2526"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/533"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2524"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
