Her subject, <em>Beyond Social Networking<\/em>, was about innovations in digital technologies that have great potential to give women better access to information, communication and publication in the near future. She based her argument on the MirandaNet knowledge exchange activities on the web that transverse national, cultural, social and faith boundaries.<\/p>\n<p>The talk\u00a0 began with Jung&#8217;s twentieth century description of \u2018liminal space\u2019 that has been applied to traditional modes of learning where the solitary learner encounters difficulties and misunderstandings that are resolved as established knowledge is mastered.\u00a0 Since 1992 , MirandaNet members have been investigating the ways in which collaborative professional learning takes place in liminal spaces that are enriched by remotely authored digital environments. In these spaces MirandaNet members are investigating how the \u00a0building of new knowledge, theory and practice might be supported by scaffolding the use of social networking, microblogging, digital mind mapping, distributed video and other innovative technologies. From these shared liminal spaces beyond the screen provocative questions emerge about the relationship between learning, collaboration and innovation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many of the alumni are now grandmothers and a key question was over concerns that their grandhildren are using computers too much rather than interacting with people and Nature. Dr Preston shared those concerns,\u00a0 but suggested that solutions were in better training for parents and teachers about the appropriate use of computers. Indeed,\u00a0 she suggested that learning can be enhanced by the use of computers and talked about her 87 year old mother who has just\u00a0 published her autobiography on the web. Nevertheless she did not think that young people would benefit by being unsupervised on the web as long as the supervisors understood the exciting developments were emerging improving knowledge and increasing publication opportunities for all. Her view was also that negative views about banning computers are as likely to succeed as a movement to ban the pencil! So best to embrace the positive and, meanwhile, install NetNanny style software on the computer to make it safe.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/keynotes-and-papers\/beyond-social-networking\/the-panel\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2624\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2624\" title=\"the panel\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/the-panel-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"397\" height=\"297\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/the-panel-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/the-panel.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Presentation in .pdf<span style=\"font-family: Calibri,Verdana,Helvetica,Arial;\">\u00a0\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/keynotes-and-papers\/beyond-social-networking\/oxford-september-v8-2012\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2628\">Beyond Social networking<\/a><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In September 2012\u00a0 Dr Christina Preston,\u00a0Professor of Educational Innovation at the Institute for Research in Education (IREd), University of Bedfordshire,\u00a0 spoke at the Gaudy Celebration for St Hilda&#8217;s College, Oxford, England.
