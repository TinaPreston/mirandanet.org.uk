The day was held as an element of the ITTE conference in order to keep the meeting costs as low as possible.<\/p>\n<p>In this all day workshop the expert participants who all use digital technologies in teaching and learning \u00a0looked at the connection between creativity and ICT in general concluding with investigating closely how learning about digital technologies in teaching and learning can be enhanced by creative thinking techniques.<\/p>\n<p>The programme began with two keynotes: the first was a general address about the need to reconceptualise technology in order to enhance teaching and learning. The second keynote was an introduction to the main principle of the EU funded HandsOn project. These keynotes were followed by three symposia on topics related to creativity in teaching and learning, creative practice in ICT and the need for creativity in teaching ICT. Finally\u00a0 a MirandaMod was staged that aimed to draw together on a digital map some key ideas about the different ways in which\u00a0 creativity can be used on the teaching of ICT. The MirandaMod at the end of the day provided the participants with an opportunity to understand other points of view and build new knowledge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>09:00 &#8211; 09:30<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Keynote: Reconceptualising technology- enhanced teaching and learning.<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Michelle.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5200\" title=\"Michelle\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Michelle-300x206.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"206\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Michelle-300x206.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Michelle-1024x705.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Michelle.jpg 1748w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Dr Michelle Selinger, Cisco and MirandaNet member<\/h4>\n<p>Distance, virtual and blended learning are used interchangeably, yet in the last 20 years the opportunity and tools have developed so rapidly we have had little time to fully digest and reconsider teaching in the light of these changes.

Digital technologies are having a profound impact on our culture and one of the most significant is a clearly perceptible shift from a text based to a visually enabled culture.<\/p>\n<p>Through visual metaphors we engage with on our everyday technologies, mobile devices and computer interfaces, we are moving (back) to more visually oriented ways of working. Infographics and video narratives are regularly included in learning activities. Mind-maps enable us to share our ideas collaboratively (Cuthell 2010), and visual curation tools help us build and share knowledge. Whilst it is easy to capture, create, edit and share visual data its potential for learning is not yet fully recognised or exploited.<\/p>\n<p>This has nothing to do with the \u201c(myth of) learning styles\u201d, (Wheeler, 2011), but is about digital and visual literacy and their importance for learning. Our challenge in education is to recognise the impact of visual culture on cognition and beyond, and to harness its potential for learning and our practice as educators. As Papert (1975) prophesised, the use of computer metaphors by children will have effects beyond what is normally classed as \u201ccognitive skill\u201d. We expect it will influence their language, imagery, games, social interactions (Papert 1975).<\/p>\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><br \/>\nCuthell, J., <em>Towards a Theory of Visual Learning<\/em>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.virtuallearning.org.uk\/?page_id=148\">http:\/\/www.virtuallearning.org.uk\/?page_id=148<\/a>\u00a0\u00a0 accessed 31 May 3 2013<br \/>\nPapert, S,.(1975) <em>An Evaluative Study of Modern Technology in Education,\u00a0 <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.papert.org\/articles\/AnEvaluativeStudyofModernTechnology.html\">http:\/\/www.papert.org\/articles\/AnEvaluativeStudyofModernTechnology.html<\/a> <em>accessed<\/em> 31 May 2013<br \/>\nWheeler, S., (2011) <em>A convenient Untruth, <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/steve-wheeler.blogspot.co.uk\/2011\/11\/convenient-untruth.html\">http:\/\/steve-wheeler.blogspot.co.uk\/2011\/11\/convenient-untruth.htm<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/steve-wheeler.blogspot.co.uk\/2011\/11\/convenient-untruth.html\"><em>l<\/em><\/a><em> accessed 2 June 2013 <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Flat Classroom Project: From Consumption to Creation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Dr Katya Toneva: St Mary&#8217;s University College,<\/p>\n<p>In the Autumn term 2011, the International Community School (ICS), London, took part in the global collaborative Flat Classroom Project [2].

The process involved: members of the technology team visiting schools that had already integrated a range of mobile technologies into daily use; the identification of relevant research and its circulation to staff; feedback from those early adopters in school who were already using mobile devices; school involvement in a DoE funded research project; and a survey of parent, student, governor and staff views on the use of personal devices. Once this data had been collected and evaluated, a development plan was implemented. By January of 2013 wi-fi had been set up across the school and all staff devices enabled for use on the system.

This pilot builds on existing research into the impact on learning when hearing is boosted by Lightspeed audio distribution technology. The presentation introduces the innovative technology, Flexcat, which has been specifically designed to support the delivery of a differentiated curriculum where small group collaborative learning predominates.\u00a0 The teacher is able to address the whole class or just one group and is able to unobtrusively listen in to group work activity.\u00a0 The system is designed to improve teacher direction and re-direction of individual groups whether inside or outside the classroom. The research measures whether this intervention significantly improves the quality of informal formative assessments, feedback to students and lesson planning. The results of the evaluation will be discussed in terms of the primary benefits of using the system for teachers and students.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Big Brother or supportive sister?<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong> The Role of Video Technology in the Mentoring and Coaching<\/strong><br \/>\nDewi Lloyd. IRIS Connect MirandaNet associate with Professor Christina Preston<\/p>\n<p>Digital video technology has been proven in research to be valuable in supporting the development the development of reflective practice by enabling trainee teachers to review their own teaching whilst in the presence of a mentor or coach. Asking the learners to provide feedback on the trainee\u2019s teaching is also an interesting route. Experiments highlight the transformative contribution such learning conversations can make to enhancing the professional knowledge of both mentors and trainees. In particular Kennewell et al\u2019s study investigated the benefits for teachers of Video Supported Reflective Dialogue (VSRD) through which teachers identified particular extracts from a video of one of their lessons to use as the basis for reflective analysis with a cognitive coach skilled in the use of dialogic discourse. The pair co-constructed knowledge with a view to deepening their understanding about the process of teaching and learning. This approach is also valuable for SEN teachers who often feel isolated in a large school. Using the latest video technology they can mentor each other by viewing lessons and annotating them thus developing new techiques (Rik Bennett 2010).<\/p>\n<p>What will be discussed in this presentation is the advanced technology that is now available and the issues that appear to be emerging from these research which are the locus of control regarding who selects what will be seen (the observer or the observed); and the locus of control for the analysis (i.e.who deconstructs and reconstructs the practice?).

The problem for them is how they will gain the skills to teach principles of programming and computational thinking to young people without adequate government support. The new emphasis on computing science has given rise to the use of\u00a0 a number of applications that can be used to teach coding in a much more simplified way, such as Scratch, Blockly, Waterbear, and Greenfoot for example. However, many professional programmers have expressed concerns about this simplification of coding skills.\u00a0 My contention will be whether programs like Scratch and Blockly can really be considered as proper coding tools, or whether they represent a &#8216;dumbed-down cop-out&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What should the balance be in the classroom between Digital Literacy, Information Technology and Computer Science?<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ian Lynch, GEBOL associate and MirandaNet Fellow<\/p>\n<p>In the MirandaNet submission to the Department for Education about the Computing curriculum members\u2019 advised that the balance between Digital Literacy, Information Technology and Computer Science should not be weighted too much towards coding.

In this context, each of the symposia were designed to come to a group view about the most important issues raised when all the speakers&#8217; perspectives are considered. Each of the speakers had been asked to concentrate on the key debating points in their 12 minute presentation which left 12 minutes in the session for the participants to draw out the main points collaboratively.<\/p>\n<p>****************************************************************************<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for support from our associates who sponsored the HandsOn drinks reception after the workshop.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/IRIS_TAG_RGB_LRG_007.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft  wp-image-5090\" title=\"IRIS_TAG_RGB_LRG_007\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/IRIS_TAG_RGB_LRG_007.png\" width=\"325\" height=\"203\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/IRIS_TAG_RGB_LRG_007.png 1905w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/IRIS_TAG_RGB_LRG_007-300x186.png 300w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/IRIS_TAG_RGB_LRG_007-1024x636.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Lightspeed-logo-hi-res.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5089\" title=\"Lightspeed logo hi-res\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Lightspeed-logo-hi-res.jpg\" width=\"440\" height=\"81\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Lightspeed-logo-hi-res.jpg 440w, https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Lightspeed-logo-hi-res-300x55.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; \u00a0Collaborative professional knowledge building activities for teacher educators, vocational trainers and primary and secondary school teachers July 9th Handson workshop at the Park Inn, Bedford, Bedfordshire Aims: to understand more about how the principles of teaching and learning creatively &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/events-2\/bedford-itte-conference-8th-10th-july-2013\/mirandanet-symposia-at-itte\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":4264,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/4967"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4967"}],"version-history":[{"count":177,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/4967\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5860,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/4967\/revisions\/5860"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/4264"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4967"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
