MirandaNet Fellows agree that with Scratch and Raspberry Pi computer science can be an exciting activity, however, some children will not find coding absorbing if this is the main or even the only activity available to them. The MirandaNet membership is also concerned that adequate plans do not yet exist to train existing ICT teachers to code.\u00a0 The after-school clubs run by volunteers and funded by industry are a worthy attempt to fill the gap &#8211; but do not constitute the kind of national programme that the potential multinational employers and computer science departments of universities can have confidence in as a preparation for further study and work. In fact, much of the discussion about the detail of the new computing curriculum is academic since academies, free schools and private schools do not have to follow the programme. Another challenge for the schools that do opt for the new Computing curriculum as it stands is that these schools will not pass their OFSTED inspections because the new programme is so limited. What concerns the membership most are two points about the relationship between government and professionals in educational matters. This first\u00a0 is the lack of respect for the professionalism of organisations like MirandaNet, ITTE and Naace who have been central to the design of the ICT curriculum in\u00a0 the past and already agree that now is the time to make some radical changes in terms of more computer science in line with global opinion. Yet these organisations were by-passed in the initial curriculum planning. The second concern is about the democratic process behind this consultation: the current Computing draft was changed behind closed doors by members of the BCS, CAS and BAEng after the consultation with other professional bodies and individuals was completed. Debate is a better way of gaining the support of professionals in a democracy than stealth. For the sake of citizens of the future, governments and educators in a democracy should be working together to gain the best results for schools. We hope will be the future pathway will be true consultation. In particular, the MirandaNet Fellowship would like to offer their expertise in the design of ICT professional development for teachers that will make a difference to children&#8217;s achievement. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/ICT-curriculum-submission.pdf\">Read the full report<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Other submissions and concerns<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Computing in Schools:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/academy.bcs.org\/content\/ict-programme-study\">The CAS submission<\/a> (you can also view the <a href=\"https:\/\/draftin.com\/documents\/43564?token=JgBy27nL7rZcy9qjte0glQOdKh4j5q6gks2uh_ok6fU\">Evolving CAS guidance notes<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li><strong>NAACE: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.naace.co.uk\/naacecurriculum\/\">The NAACE submission<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>ITTE:<\/strong> A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.itte.org.uk\/system\/files\/ITTE%20letter%20on%20CS%20ITT.pdf\">letter to Gove from MirandaNet, NAACE and ITTE<\/a> about ending the training of ICT teachers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Background to the MirandaNet report<\/h2>\n<p>Since the announcement of the proposed disapplication of the ICT curriculum by Gove at the BETT12 exhibition the arguments have progressed in MirandaNet about the best way to respond. The final submission considers the balance between Digital Literacy, Information Technology and Computer Science and concludes that there should be an equal balance between the three in order to provide a rounded education. MirandaNetters had significant concerns about the current \u00a0lurch towards coding which in concentration would not be the aspect of computing that attracted all students equally. <strong>A repository of different perspectives follows below<\/strong> <strong>The Westminster papers<\/strong> The Westminster Forum on 28th February showed the breadth of our vision as a membership.
