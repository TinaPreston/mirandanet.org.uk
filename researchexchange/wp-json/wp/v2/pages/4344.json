Working for both a UK and a German university, it is a<br \/>\nfascinating experience to see both worlds. And, being originally from<br \/>\nGermany, I am aware of the fact that Germans somehow have a reputation<br \/>\nof being anxious when it comes to change.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, when I first looked at the new ICT curriculum, it did in<br \/>\nfact seem a bit strange to me, with regard to aiming at teaching 5 year<br \/>\nold pupils to understand what algorithms are. By comparing it to when<br \/>\nGerman schools start to teach informatics or computer science related<br \/>\nsubjects to pupils, this is normally not being done before the age of 10<br \/>\n(which holds true for Bavaria, where I am coming from).<\/p>\n<p>In some federal states (education in Germany is entirely up to the federal state) it is<br \/>\nnot even mandatory to teach informatics or computer science at all.<br \/>\nHowever, digital literacy issues are taught throughout the country.<br \/>\nLooking back at how I became a computer science professor, I did not<br \/>\nstart using a computer or thinking about algorithms before I was<br \/>\nsixteen. We had a small computer room in secondary school (Commodore PET<br \/>\nmachines), on which I started writing simple programs for evaluating<br \/>\nphysical formulas and later on writing simple computer games like e.g.<br \/>\ntennis. Later on, I bought an old Commodore PET from one of our teachers<br \/>\nand published programs for the Commodore64 in the mid 1980s, before I<br \/>\nfinally studied electrical engineering with an emphasis on computer<br \/>\nscience, did my PhD and became a professor at the University of<br \/>\nBedfordshire.<\/p>\n<p>You can see more of my presentation below:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/Karsten-0213.pdf\">Comparing computing in England and Germany<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dr Karsten Trinitis, Professor of Compuer Science at the Universities of Munich and Bedfordshire First of all, let me thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak at the Westminster Forum and get directly in touch with representatives from &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/publications\/articles\/ict-curriculum-mirandas-views\/do-5-year-olds-need-know-about-algorithms-are\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":4058,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/4344"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4344"}],"version-history":[{"count":9,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/4344\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4419,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/4344\/revisions\/4419"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/4058"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4344"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
