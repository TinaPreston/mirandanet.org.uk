Their work since the 1950s has been inspiring in the analysis of contexts where constructive learning is being promoted &#8211; but many members of this movement concentrate on the scoring of maps rather than the quality of the learning which is not the aspect of mapping that \u00a0MirandaNet Fellows are interested in.<\/p>\n<p>Concept maps have been a key area of research in the\u00a0 MirandaNet Fellowship since about 2000.

This division helps to identify two types of educators: those who mostly think about concept maps as a means of presenting existing knowledge and ideas in a visual way; and those educators who are more interested in how the map maker has presented new and original connections in creative ensembles. This second position indicates an interest in what the map makers know already rather than what has been retained of has been taught. Of course, some educators see the maps from both perspectives: representational and multimodal.<\/p>\n<p>The focus of\u00a0 the discussion in this article\u00a0 is mainly on how the concept maps are used as research tools. Comments are made on how various theories relate to the methodological position taken by the ImpaCT2 team who were funded by Becta to look at how digital technologies might improve achievement. During the discussion I also comment on how the use of the maps in the literature relates to four different pedagogical perspectives : information transmission; constructivism; and social interaction.<\/p>\n<p>What also emerges is how the academic definitions play out in various contexts. The key terms are \u2018concept maps\u2019, \u2018mind maps\u2019 and \u2018multimodal maps\u2019 and their relationship with \u2018multidimensional concept maps\u2019 that are defined as complex multimodal signs in terms of makers, production, levels and modes. Overall the literature study moves from positivist approaches to concept map analysis that stem from a representational viewpoint towards qualitative strategies that are more considerate of the map makers\u2019 perspective. The latter tends to be the stance of those interested in multimodality, meaning making and qualifiable multimodal meaning-making. Thirdly the review analyses the literature that covers concept maps as complex multimodal signs. In this section the multimodal affordances of concept mapping software are discussed. Finally I turn to the multiple relationships that are facilitated when concept maps are used between the educator, the researcher and the map maker.<\/p>\n<p>The article is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/\u2018The-universality-and-ubiquity-of-concept-maps\u2019.pdf\">\u2018The universality and ubiquity of concept maps\u2019(1)<\/a>.

Whilst these tools provided data about the complexity of the maps that had been created, they failed to provide data that related to the process of knowledge construction. They also concentrate on the learning of individuals rather than on collaborative learning.<\/p>\n<p>What was needed, therefore, was a system that enabled the process of knowledge construction to be tracked, identified and analysed as it takes place within a professional group. The functionality of the program enabled the elements of collaborative mapping process to be identified, together with the identity of those involved in the process.<\/p>\n<p>In order to develop a new scoring methodology data sets were compiled that could be analysed across a number of dimensions. As a result of the analysis seven types of collaborative learning activities were identified in the creation of the maps: Adding; Editing; Inserting; Moving; Removing; Renaming and Repositioning. Each activity could be related to the relevant mapmaker, and the inter-related processes of constructing the map and building knowledge could be identified. The sequences of mapping actions were graphed, and the resulting graphs plotted the frequency of each activity across the progress of the creation of the maps. The graphs showed the inter-relationship of actions, particularly those of inserting, renaming and repositioning \u2013 the key activities in the process of knowledge creation.<\/p>\n<p>The analysis of the maps in this initial stage indicates the potential effectiveness of the methodology in building a picture of the collaborative knowledge process, rather than the existing models of either content analysis of map complexity.<\/p>\n<p>It can be further said that the complexity of the maps is directly related to the number of contributions by, and interactions of, the mapmakers. This initial study has revealed the complexity of the task of finding an effective methodology that will reflect the multiple perspectives from which this data is drawn.\u00a0 The preliminary outcomes raise a series of questions:<\/p>\n<p>How effective are collaborative concept maps in creating a record of an event?<\/p>\n<p>How do collaborative concept maps stimulate thinking and debate in a space and dimension other than the face-to-face environment or the virtual FlashMeeting?<\/p>\n<p>How do collaborative concept maps facilitate new thinking that can support professional development and feed back into the institution?<\/p>\n<p>In the next stage these questions will be used to inform a system for a more extensive evaluation of these multidimensional concept maps. The analysis of their effectiveness in identifying concept development and the formation of praxis in the context of work-based learning for education professionals will be part of this longer study, which should tell us more about the nature of collaborative professional learning.<\/p>\n<div>\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\" \/>\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]<\/a> <a href=\"..\/..\/\">http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk<\/a> Last accessed 18<sup>th<\/sup> August<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]<\/a> <a href=\"..\/..\/mirandamods\/\">http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/mirandamods\/<\/a> Last accessed 18<sup>th<\/sup> August<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref3\">[3]<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Unconference\">http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Unconference<\/a> Last accessed 18<sup>th<\/sup> August<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref4\">[4]<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mindmeister.com\/\">http:\/\/www.mindmeister.com<\/a><\/div>\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref5\">[5]<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inspiration.com\/\">http:\/\/www.inspiration.com\/<\/a> Last accessed 18<sup>th<\/sup> August<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\"><br \/>\n<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u2018The universality and ubiquity of concept maps\u2019 The title of this article is also the title of a keynote by the two gurus of concept mapping, Alberto\u00a0Canas and Jim Novak in Chile at the international concept mapping conference in 2010 &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/events-2\/research-themes\/concept-mapping-as-a-research-tool\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":1337,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/354"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=354"}],"version-history":[{"count":10,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/354\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1571,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/354\/revisions\/1571"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1337"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=354"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
