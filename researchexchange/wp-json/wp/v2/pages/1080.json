I\u2019m studying to\u00a0 become a teacher. I am currently volunteering part time at a local school helping children learn to read. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t do well at first coming to university but as the years have gone by I have gained more confidence. I have also learnt a lot about the sociology, psychology and history of childhood as my course requires me to know a large amount of theory. As any school is a busy environment I have also learnt how to communicate with children as well as with the members of staff that keep the school running. Also for one of my units I am working on a dissertation looking at the educational benefits of games concerning young children. I am a quick learner and am excited to get started. Working as part of a team is something I\u2019ve done all my life and it\u2019s a great way to find the best solution to a problem. Of course I am also capable at working on my own. I\u2019m a strong believer in child centered education and I want to give the best teaching I can to all my students in the future. My punctuality and attendance records have always been kept to a high standard. In short, I would describe myself as an out-going individual who always thrives at any given task.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Nadia Shaheen<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1274\" title=\"Nadia\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/Nadia.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"130\" height=\"80\" \/>My name is Nadia Shaheen and I am currently in my final year studying (BA) Education Studies at the University of Bedfordshire. I hope to pursue a career in teaching in the future. I have a range of experience in working with children, being part of the Universities Access Partnership Associate scheme has allowed me to gain many skills including planning, communication, and team work skills. Through this scheme I have been enabled opportunities to help out on University open days, and events as well as go into schools and prepare sessions that increase awareness of the opportunities offered by Higher Education and assisting students on planning for the future and preparation for work.<\/p>\n<p>I have also completed two years of voluntary work at Friends of Bright Eyes (FOBE) which is a charity that provides respite care and support for young children with disabilities and their families. I supported much needed projects, summer play schemes and fun stimulating activities to make the children\u2019s time enjoyable at the centre. I have been working on a one-to-one basis with the children in order to encourage them to explore variety of activities in their daily routines. I would describe myself as a hard working student who is keen for opportunities of personal and academic development both for myself and subsequently to facilitate the effective development of others. I am also interested in volunteering at charity events as it is definitely an enjoyable experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Godfre<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1107\" title=\"Godfrey\" src=\"http:\/\/www.mirandanet.org.uk\/researchexchange\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/Godfrey.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"124\" height=\"166\" \/>y Chipunda<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I am Godfrey Chipunda completing a\u00a0 BA (HON) Education Studies at the University of Bedfordshire . l have worked for\u00a0 Wickes Trevis Perkins for 6 years.
