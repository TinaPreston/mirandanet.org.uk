					<description><![CDATA[Christina asked us all for comments on the draft curriculum. Mine are organised by section below.

Aims &#038; Principles:  Include ‘safely’ in Can critically evaluate and apply information technology (including new or unfamiliar technologies) confidently, responsibly, collaboratively and effectively to solve problems and work creatively. 

Don’t understand purpose of including “Learn to see problems in computational terms” here.

KS1: Deep concern that “Understand what algorithms are and that these are implemented as programs on digital devices; use knowledge of algorithms to write simple programs.” is inappropriate language for both KS1 and their teachers – introducing pupils to logical sequencing and floor turtles, other toys is as far as I would go. If this is all that is actually intended then that needs to be said.

KS2: Concern re what would need to be taken out of the KS2 curriculum in order to spend the time that would be necessary to teach programming to the detail specified – there is too little at KS4 and too much here – more thought as to progression from child’s perspectives and abilities needed please. 

KS3: a clearer approach though uncertain as to what complex goals might be in “select, use and assemble multiple applications across a range of devices to achieve complex goals” . Should it be &quot;Recognise the impact of digital &lt;i&gt; and mobile &lt;/i&gt;technologies on society ?

KS4: Surprise as to “ethical, moral, legal and environmental aspects of information systems” in KS4, the differences between ethical and moral are nuanced and usually beyond me let alone a teenager – do we mean &#039;ethical and social&#039; which is the more common phrase? 

General concern throughout that without context and examples teachers will feel threatened by the new terminology and start teaching programming from non-age appropriate textbooks tentatively and badly. I am not seeing a ‘pupil voice’ in this – how can I show others what can I do with a computer, mobile phone etc.]]></description>
