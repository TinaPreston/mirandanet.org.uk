  <p><strong>Ireland</strong></p>
  <p>Eileen Brennan-Freeman, one of our Irish Scholars, drew my attention to a 
    web essay by an American professor about colleagues who have been sacked for 
    talking about peace. It is a well argued essay that many of you will want 
    to read about the lack of critical thinking in US education. </p>
  <p>(Democracy, Freedom, and Justice after September 11th: Rethinking the Role 
    of Educators and the Politics of Schooling - <a href="http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?ContentID=10871">www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?ContentID=10871</a>) 
  </p>
  <p>On that theme I attended a conference on Thinking Skills run by Questions, 
    the magazine publishers. I had been really keen to find out about this much 
    praised new approach to learning. The keynote speaker who is Canadian, Sharon 
    Bailin, suggested that in all subjects children should be encouraged to weigh 
    up the evidence and come to opinions of their own. I was horrified. All the 
    techniques she suggested were second nature in my classroom fifteen years 
    ago. Have things changed? Is it all information transmission now? Surely not?

  <p><strong>Czech Republic</strong></p>
  <p>So on to Prague where Czech Miranda Fellows are devastated by the new government 
    plans to spend large sums on hardware, resources and ICT professional development 
    for teachers. The news of this new funding seemed very positive last year, 
    but now a deal has been done with a consortium led by Microsoft who will do 
    all the supplying. CPD will be delivered in the first year to all teachers 
    by means of customised handbooks on Office and Access. Our colleagues have 
    tried to protest, but been ignored. Totalitarianism by another name, Gates. 
  </p>
  <p>We will be holding a Czech Miranda seminar in Prague on Tuesday May 7th, 
    half term week, and would love more MN speakers. There is no funding although 
    we can find inexpensive university accommodation. There may be time for a 
    British Council travel grant. </p>
  <p>Let 
    Christina
    know if you are interested in presenting your work to Czech teachers. </p>
  <p><strong>Bulgaria</strong></p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Katya Toneva, MirandaNet Fellow and ICT professor at a teacher 
    education university accepted an invitation with seven of her teaching colleagues, 
    to teach in a South Coast secondary school. The Bulgarian Teachers had the 
    highest regard for our system and hoped to learn more, as well as support 
    school which was desperate for staff. The head's wife is Bulgarian which is 
    how this came about.</p>
  <p>The eight very experienced teachers are being paid as instructors which means 
    that the school has a good deal. But I could not believe my ears when I heard 
    what has happened. These Bulgarian teachers have been racially abused, not 
    only by the children, but the teachers. What is happening to tolerance in 
    this country?</p>
  <p>Katya has written a reasoned essay about their observations of the English 
    State system which asks fundamental questions about the way we see ourselves 
    called:</p>
  <p>A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE PEDAGOGICAL PRACTICE IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
    OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND BULGARIA</p>
  <p>She says that she has written this paper </p>
  <p>"to compare the strong sides and the weaknesses of the British and Bulgarian 
    pedagogical practice in the secondary schools of the United Kingdom and the 
    Republic of Bulgaria. </p>
  <p>The main point is to define a model of pedagogical practice, which should 
    be a multicultural one, or in other words to represent the result of intercultural 
    interactions between two basically very different educational cultures. By 
    and large, this is a difficult task, so the authors will not offer a ready-made 
    recipe, i.e. a ready-made model, but will just outline the way to forming 
    such a model through examples, case studies and episodes from their own pedagogical 
    practice. </p>
  <p>We plan to base this multicultural model on the basis of a wide-scale discussion 
    on the pages of the specialized periodicals in Bulgaria and the United Kingdom 
    as well as in other European countries participating in the project MirandaNet. 
  </p>
  <p>We would like our Bulgarian, British and, in a word, European colleagues, 
    to publish their opinions, evaluations and examples from their own experience, 
    which would help elaborating the multicultural model of the pedagogical practice 
    in future unified Europe. </p>
  <p>Katya's ideas are very close to pedagogical models that Bryn Holmes, Marilyn 
    Leask and I have been developing in relation to communities of practice. Katya 
    will be presenting at the next MirandaNet seminar on Thursday 16th May with 
    us. If you would like to come please contact Karen Glass. I hope there will 
    be enough of you there to prove that their experience on the South Coast is 
    not the rule in this country. </p>
  <p><strong>Miranda China</strong></p>
  <p>We have just had confirmation of the British Council funds to set up a Chinese 
    Miranda with some very keen teachers there. I'd like to know who would like 
    to be involved. Please send me school details and a small description. The 
    Chinese will be coming here first but I do not know when yet. It would be 
    a good project for the British Council International Professional Development 
    Scholarships and the DFES Best Practice Research Bursaries. Ask Kaz about 
    how to apply for these.<br>
    Washington</p>
  <p>Mara Chrystie and I will be out in Washington at the end of March sorting 
    out the final details of the Fulbright scholarship exchange with Fellows from 
    the North and London. <br>
    We have found that the US Teachers are reluctant to travel. All children and 
    teachers have been grounded in Washington since September 11th and hope that 
    our presence will help them to think more positively.</p>
  <p><br>
    We have tagged this Washington visit onto our attendance at the SITE02 conference, 
    Nashville, Tennessee which we are funding ourselves. Niki Davis is the president 
    of SITE which is like ITTE for teacher educators. We are working with international 
    colleagues on building on-line communities of practice. Carol Webb, Bryn Holmes 
    and John Cuthell will also be there. We will give you all feedback after Easter. 
  </p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Miranda North News</strong><br>
    A number of MirandaNorth members are in the process of moving schools, so 
    during the next two terms names and addresses are bound to go astray! So, 
    the best of luck to those seeking promotion. I'm sure that you'll be able 
    to expand MirandaNorth participation in your new schools. </p>
  <p>Except, that is, for Fiona Garret. She's got married, moved back to London 
    and changed her name, so colleagues in the south who meet Fiona Dorman will 
    experience a slight change of deja-vu. Fiona is still working on Think.com 
    projects. </p>
  <p>Six MirandaNorth scholars completed their DfES Best Practice Research Awards 
    during 2001. Some of the case studies are already on the MirandaNet site, 
    and it's hoped that the others will be available before too long. Tim Farr, 
    from Rainhill Learning centre, has just submitted an extremely exciting proposal 
    for this year's awards. It's to be hoped that he's successful in his application. 
  </p>
  <p>Links with MiraNet Bulgaria are continuing. Liz Smith, from Boston Spa Comprehensive 
    School is collaborating with the High School for Mathematics and Science in 
    Varna on a web-based Mathematics project. </p>
  <p>The shock waves from the September 11 attacks on the United States have delayed 
    preparations for the Fulbright Exchange with schools around Washington. Colleagues 
    from Hartlepool and Leeds hope that arrangements will be made in time for 
    their exchange in May and June. </p>
  <p>On a final note, Promethean are offering significant discounts on whiteboards, 
    together with free training. If any colleagues wish to take up this offer 
    for their schools, contact Karen Glass or John Cuthell. </p>

  <p><strong>DO: Digital Opportunities</strong></p>
  <p>E-learning achievements by Gifted, Disaffected and Disadvantaged students 
  </p>
  <p>Summary</p>
  <p>During the academic year 2000 - 2001 five teachers in Yorkshire built up 
    classroom evidence that indicates that e-learning is a significant learning 
    tool for learners with special needs: particularly students who are gifted 
    and those who are disaffected by the school system. </p>
  <p>E-learning was not used as a tool for information transmission but as an 
    effective means of encouraging unconfident young people to publish their interests 
    and to engage in participative dialogue and debate with others. The impact 
    on their self-esteem was a major reason for the progress that they made. The 
    opportunity to publish and communicate online about subjects that interest 
    them personally appears to have a significant effect on their school performance 
    and on their relationships with teachers and other students. In some cases, 
    using e-learning as a catalyst, teachers were able to build up a rapport with 
    difficult students that they had not thought possible. Two detailed DFES Best 
    practice action research studies have been written by Fiona Garrett and Richard 
    Robinson. You can find them on the Mirandanet web site.</p>
  <p>The project will use an e-learning web space designed to create active magazines 
    on line called webzines that attract reluctant learners, raise self-esteem 
    and reduce the sense of difference. During this year teachers will draw on 
    citizenship materials and on developing thinking skills, both areas where 
    disadvantaged young people may benefit from engagement. The webzines which 
    will be created on Think.com will be an ideal tool to promote discussion and 
    thinking in these areas. Publication areas for interesting extracts will be 
    developed on the MirandaNet website so that more schools are encouraged to 
    develop webzines as well. Students will be encouraged to invite students all 
    over the world to engage in discussion and information sharing in specialist 
    topics that interest them. The greater number of students involved the better 
    will be the opportunities for interaction.</p>
  <p>One focus funded by Toshiba will be the use of notebook computers by the 
    students both at school and at home, exploring the impact on engagement and 
    learning progress. Another focus will be the place of interactive whiteboards 
    in learning progress used by students rather than teachers funded by Promethean. 
    Tower Hamlets and Kent LEA are funding mobiles and extra equipment including 
    digital cameras which may be a third focus of activity.</p>
  <p>MirandaNet members are encouraged to attend the ICT CPD workshop on May 16th 
    to meet the teacher participants and to plan to join the project in the Third 
    stage starting in September. </p>

  <p><strong>Tools for Schools</strong></p>
  <p>I am now a Trustee of the Tools for Schools recycled computer charity and 
    Toshiba kindly sponsored some of these Compaqs for MirandaNet students. MirandaNet 
    have recently bought 100 recycled Compaq mobiles donated by Morgan Stanley. 
    For the DO project. We are loading the Sun Star Office integrated package 
    on which is free to Schools. Kaz has the details.</p>
  <p>Trevor Matthews at Tools for Schools reports that the BBC has just donated 
    a large number of systems. These machines are mainly Pentium IIs with 17&quot; 
    monitors. Once Tools for Schools has fully refurbished the kit and upgraded 
    it to multimedia, it will be available with an operating system, three-month 
    warranty and delivery for &pound;95 per system. You can also buy Internet 
    and networks cards. See: <a href="http://www.tfs.org.uk/">www.tfs.org.uk</a></p>
  <p>The site gives details on how schools and LEAs can apply.</p>

    for the gifted, the disaffected and the disadvantaged</p>
  <p><strong>Web Wise Wapping </strong></p>
  <p>We have three years to prove the value of communities of practice in Wapping. 
    This is a sensible time scale and one in which we expect to prove that long 
    term attention to teachers' ICT professional development needs does have measurable 
    results and can produce a sustainable community. </p>
  <p>The enthusiasm of colleagues in the Web-Wise Wapping project is a joy. Yes 
    of course they are busy, but they are managing to fit this into their programme 
    because the benefits for children's learning seem clear. The MirandaNet team 
    do not underestimate, however, the effect of going into a community which 
    is already resolved to share and co-operate. It is this spirit which is driving 
    it forward, a well as a safe environment for risk talking and a willingness 
    to make mistakes. </p>
  <p>A group of the class teachers are working on "Using ICT to enrich the National 
    Curriculum for classroom teachers" with projects such as: history of the school 
    area, settlements in Wapping, Literacy and astronomy. Bigland Green and Cyril 
    Jackson are working on Family Books with Bengali mothers which they are demonstrating 
    for the DFES Roadshows. Another group of Teachers are using ICT to extend 
    beyond the National Curriculum" with Francis Howlett. They are developing 
    a WWW public web page some wonderful links to easily access each school's 
    website.</p>
  <p>Miranda Ross, from Shapla Primary, a new MirandaNet scholar, was invited 
    by Oracle, to San Francisco to learn more about Think.com and through her 
    expertise has set up some links on Think.com so that everyone can look at 
    each others school page and work together on similar projects. She has also 
    developed a Quick Links page so that you can access each school's information 
    quickly and share ideas together. </p>
  <p>The Head Teachers in conjunction with John Cuthell are working on ideas for 
    "Using ICT as a catalyst for change in teaching and learning for heads and 
    senior managers." as well as being involved in some of the classroom projects. 
    We hope to link this in with our MirandaNet Chinese senior managers who have 
    also identified change management as an area where like us they have much 
    to learn. </p>
  <p>All the WWW participants have mastered Think.com which is proving a really 
    useful framework for developing and publishing the project information. Here 
    are some of the school links<br>
    (If you are not registered on Think.com you can do this via the MirandaNet 
    site).</p>
  <p>Shapla Primary School<br>
    Miranda Ross from Shapla says "You can use think.com to share ideas and collaborate 
    more easily ie. Via stickies"<br>
    Link to Shapla's site to contribute to Year 5 interactive stories and phone 
    book character hotseats, and Year 1's local area project</p>
  <p>Hermitage Primary School<br>
    Get involved with local area studies focusing on exploring community sculpture 
    or developing the local environment, and find out about our mentoring project 
    for Year 6 and younger children, as well as many other projects<br>
    English Martyrs RC Primary School<br>
    Collaborate on a local area study<br>
    St. Patrick's RC Primary School<br>
    We aim to archive the records, diaries and school logs along with photos, 
    gathered over 125 years</p>
  <p>Mara Chrystie, John Moran, Miranda Ross and Fiona Garrett are now leading 
    teacher groups and we hope that gradually more teachers on the ground will 
    take over the reins to run this exciting project. </p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>GTC Web-based Community E-Facilitators Mentoring Programme</strong></p>
  <p>You will remember that we ran a Mirandalink conference on the General Teaching 
    Council recently in which some strong opinions were expressed. The Fellowship 
    does have an understanding of the challenges. </p>
  <p>I take the view with many of my teacher education colleagues that the GTC 
    professional body is an important step in making the profession self-regulating 
    like doctor and solicitors who tend to have higher standing than teachers. 
    I was very pleased, therefore, to win the tender to provide a three-year e-mentoring 
    programme for the e-facilitators engaged in the websites online community.</p>
  <p>The first challenge we have to face is the determined campaign to destroy 
    the GTC forums by three people who purport to be practising teachers, one 
    an NUWSA (I need to check this) representative. They have published their 
    intention to destroy the forums on the TES, GTC website and gather there like 
    ghouls to chuckle over their success. There is as yet no registration process 
    so these people cannot be traced. The e-facilitators who have just started 
    have found these vicious attacks hard to handle. We had a long discussion 
    about how to deflect this kind of assault on our democratic freedom whilst 
    not losing cool and not putting off the hundreds of fair minded teachers who 
    want to have their say. Ideas on mirandalink would be welcome. </p>
  <p>The pilot phase from January to September 2002 will be the design, planning 
    and running of a 24 hour residential workshop, the development of an accreditation 
    framework and process; e-mentoring support for the 9 GTC e-facilitators on 
    their online work. There will be recruitment of further GTC e-facilitators 
    in a national competition from September to December 2002. During this phase 
    a web based resource pack and online course will be designed and the frameworks 
    developed, and an online journal will be set up for use during the lifetime 
    of the project. From 2003 a one-year programme will be repeated each year 
    by a growing number of e-facilitators who will make up the community of practice. 
    The programme will commence with an e-facilitators induction workshop: development 
    of key skills and pursuit of professional development opportunities in year 
    1; establishment of links with other communities in pursuit of further professional 
    development and research opportunities in year 2; and promotion of self-sustainability 
    of the online community in year 3.</p>
  <p>Many MirandaNet fellows are already experienced in e-mentoring so we hope 
    you will look out for this opportunity. </p>
  <p><strong>Domex - Unity of Identity Project</strong><br>
    With DFES Domex project, the MirandaNet Fellowship is currently undertaking 
    the first stage of a Conflict Resolution project which concentrates on the 
    wider new National Curriculum subject, Citizenship. You will not be surprised 
    that we take an International view in the proposed post NOF-ICT professional 
    development programme for teachers and web-based resource pack which will 
    be available to all schools who are registered on Think.com from the end of 
    March. I hope this will be one of the initiatives that encourages you to take 
    a new look at Think.com and it's role in your school.</p>
  <p>The overall aim of UnITy is to create a wider and richer sense of identity 
    for students in East London in the six London boroughs covered by Domex. Students 
    will build a of a learning environment where key participants in the teaching 
    profession and the students themselves come together to </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>- To envision a sense of a shared future.<br>
      - To jointly create a sense of shared history<br>
      - To capture and share learning experiences</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The first phase from February to the end of April 2002 focuses on the building

    pack on Citizenship. </p>
  <p><strong>DFES Roadshows</strong> </p>
  <p>As you will know e-learning is now an important government initiative. The 
    MirandaNet Fellowship has been chosen to present sessions on e-learning in 
    the DFES Roadshows that will be held in partnership with the Broadband consortia 
    in the Midlands, the South West and in Cumbria. The dates are will be confirmed 
    later in the month.</p>

  <h2><strong><a name="ml"></a>MirandaLink</strong></h2>
  <p>Mirandalink has been a source of shared information over the last couple 
    of months. Some of the topics recently discussed were Interactive Whiteboards 
    that seem to be becoming more user friendly and in more and more workspaces. 
    Curriculum online topics such as web based resources and how to access them 
    and of course it has been a great guide to upcoming courses and information 
    that may be of interest to the mirandalink members.</p>
  <p>Don't forget if you know something or have something of interest to share 
    with your fellow MirandaNetters than please don't hesitate to share it with 
    everyone else.</p>

  <p><strong>Meng Guangyou</strong><br>
  </p>
  <p>Personal Statement <br>
    My school is a common junior high school. There are 55 classes, 3400 students 
    and 170 teachers in our school. The age of the students is about 13 to 17 
    years old. And each class has about 50 students. The subjects the students 
    learn in our school are: Chinese, Maths, English, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, 
    Geography, History, Politics, Working<br>
    skills, Computer Science (Information Technology), etc. We often use the computers 
    as tools in our teaching, to manage the routines of school management, such 
    as to manage the grades of the students, etc. to make CAI software, to download 
    the data about teaching via the Internet, and so on. Now our school is building 
    an intranet in order to share the resources of teaching material in full. 
    We speak Putonghua, just like the TV announcer speaks. </p>
  <p>ICT Interests<br>
    I am from P.R.China, and I am keen to have the answers to all about IT or 
    ICT on education, the hardwares and softwares. We Chinese teachers esp.college 
    teachers, are researching on how to integrate with IT and other subjects.</p>

  <h2> <strong><a name="mnf"></a>MN Fellows</strong></h2>
  <p>Congratulations to Tim Farr, Anne Gilleran, and Jacky Elliott who have become 
    fellows in February. Jacky Elliott has published a very interesting article 
    on the MirandaNet website about the innovative project that is happening at 
    her school at the moment. She describes how her school has loaned computers 
    and printers to students and their families in the Northwood Neighbourhood 
    of Kirby. Read all about Ruffwood@home on the <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/">MirandaNet 
    website</a>.</p>
  <p>Basia Korczak</p>
  <p>On a sad note we must once again convey our condolences to Basia, who recently 
    lost her husband, Stan. By one of those cruel ironies, Stan died of heart 
    failure on the day the hospital told him that they had a bed for him for bypass 
    surgery. Basia is one of our most imaginative scholars who has been keen to 
    share her knowledge with others. Our thoughts are with her and her family. 
    It's a long hard road through bereavement with all kinds of inevitable stages. 
    We hope that MirandaNet collegiality will offer some small relief. </p>

  <h2><strong><a name="auntie"></a>Auntie plays fast and loose</strong></h2>
  <p>BBC Curriculum Online </p>
  <p>Below I've pasted in a simple version of what the BBC offer is about. But 
    do not be fooled. This is a political minefield as Auntie plays fast and loose. 
    Is she a charity or a mult-million pound global business? Is she a self-regulating 
    body or an uncontrolled license to print money. Is she giving us a free present 
    or is this actually an order to secure a new license fee? And if we all have 
    free materials what happens to companies like Espresso and Actis who have 
    invested in web based resources? And when they are gone where will the choice 
    and diversity be? Difficult questions we should all be engaged in unless we 
    want our curriculum decided by Auntie. Democracy is a delicate flower, even 
    in UK and nothing kills it quicker than apathy.</p>
  <p>&quot;The BBC vision for curriculum online is to give teachers easy online 
    access to a wide range of digital learning materials, which they can support 
    their teaching across the curriculum. These materials will form a consistent, 
    coherent and comprehensive educational service for teachers and pupils.</p>
  <p>These materials will help free teachers to do what they do best - teach- 
    by making lesson planning and administration easier and faster and will help 
    teachers make a reality of individualised learning for all pupils. Curriculum 
    Online has been formed by a major consultation (April 2001) with many responses 
    received from a large number of individuals, from educational institutions 
    and from industry, the majority supporting the main thrust of the vision. 
    The programme was officially launched in December 2001 when the Prime Minister 
    and the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced &pound;50 million 
    worth of investment for the first school year of operation 2002/2003.</p>
  <p>Materials for Curriculum Online will be provided by a number of educational 
    content providers. Key industry figures have been involved in discussions 
    throughout the consultation process. They are continuing to work with the 
    Government to agree advancements in technical standards and develop approaches 
    to partnership aimed at making Curriculum Online a reality.&quot;</p>

  <h2><a name="trans"></a>Transforming the way we learn</h2>
  <p>A vision for the future of ICT in schools:</p>
  <p>Most government confine themselves to what can be done. Our NGFL division 
    has looked into the future of where we should be going. I think this is a 
    good read</p>
  <p>Transforming The Way We Learn presents a vision of how new technology can 
    help to transform the delivery of school-age learning in the next few years.</p>
  <p>The vision is based on reviews and emerging research and evaluation being 
    conducted by the NGFL. This application becomes effective if e-learning is 
    used alongside established teaching, learning and management techniques. It 
    must encourage and enable individuals to realise their academic and creative 
    potential.</p>

  <p>Two new sites of particular interest to SEN teachers</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.specialschool.org/">www.specialschool.org</a> is a site 
    designed by an ICT Coordinator &amp; ICTS NOF trainer to help parents, new 
    teachers and students understand the workings of a special school. The site 
    is based in Northern Ireland but will be of interest to all concerned with 
    this area of education.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.dyslexics.org.uk/">www.dyslexics.org.uk</a> is a site

  <h2> <a name="acd"></a>A creativity debate </h2>
  <p>Think.com is one resource that we have available to explore new approaches 
    to creativity and thinking skills. It would be excellent to have some feedback 
    on mirandalink if any of you join the BECTa creativity debate below.</p>
  <p>Following its trial the new Becta ICT web advice service was launched recently 
    at the Education Show: <a href="http://www.ictadvice.org.uk/">www.ictadvice.org.uk</a></p>
  <p>The site is designed to meet the everyday ICT needs of classroom teachers, 
    senior managers, subject co-ordinators and ICT co-ordinators. Services available 
    from the site include a monthly newsletter, ask an expert, discussion forums, 
    advice guides, ICT latest, an online conference and timesavers.</p>
  <p>During March the site will focus on &quot;Creativity with ICT in the Classroom&quot;. 
    A panel of experts including school practitioners, education advisors, Becta 
    Education Officers and academics, will be available to answer questions on 
    the nature of creativity and the potential offered by ICT for stimulating 
    creativity. As previously announced an online conference is planned with the 
    theme Transforming Management and Learning with ICT. It takes place on 1st/2nd 
    May.</p>
