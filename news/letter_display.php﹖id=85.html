<p><strong>MirandaNet Newsletter New Members April 2010</strong></p>
<p>Dear MirandaNetters</p> <p>As you know, I was away for most of April, and again for much of May,  but the number of new members continues to grow! So here is a warm  welcome to those who signed up in April.</p> <p>Best wishes to you all</p> <p>Christina Preston</p> <h3>Scholars</h3> <p><strong>Steven Albury</strong><a href="mailto:steven.albury@education.ox.ac.uk"></a></p> <p>As a teacher I became interested in how the language of reflective  practice and the official promotion of it within the profession was  actually put into effect. When I became a Head of Department I realised  that despite everyone agreeing it was a good idea the support mechanisms  to encourage well constructed collaborative research in order to  support the development of teachers as reflective practitioners was  largely missing. Instead schools seemed to rely on a few &#39;ICT  champions&#39;, &#39;classroom management mentors&#39; or &#39;subject learning  coaches&#39;.</p> <p>I therefore began looking at why this was the case and whether  anything could really be done about it. This has now lead me into my  doctoral study, which takes work on e-science and the use of virtual  research environments and combines it with a qualitative study of  schools identified as research-led. The aim is to design a framework for  research practice in schools that is both trustworthy and capable of  being integrated within the school&#39;s culture. Unlike a lot of work in  the area it is not focussed on individual action research style projects  or individual professional development but on treating a school as a  distributed cognitive system, that is an adaptive problem solving group.  In trying to address problems of technology integration and the role of  teaching I am keen to both add a new perspective (design-led  collaborative research by teachers based on theories of distributed  cognition) whilst retaining a grounded practical approach which will  translate to the real world of the British education system.</p> <p><strong>Julie Bain</strong><a href="mailto:julbain@gmail.com"></a></p> <p>Julie Bain is a secondary English teacher and librarian at O&rsquo;Connor  Catholic College in Armidale, NSW.  Her interest includes developing  multimodal teaching resources, using digital technologies, particularly  digital narratives, in order to assist students become critical,  multi-literate producers of texts.  She has a Master of Education from  University of New England and has recently been taking Web 2.0  technologies around New South Wales to inspire fellow teachers and  teacher librarians to make use of these technologies in their teaching.</p> <p><strong>Emma Barker</strong><a href="mailto:emmabarker1977@googlemail.com"></a></p> <p>I am a Year 5 teacher and ICT coordinator in a small primary school. I  became a teacher just two years ago; after a career in publishing. It  was always my ambition to become a teacher, but I am glad I came into  the profession later in life. I feel I have more to give and more  experiences to share, especially in the area of ICT. I am passionate  about learning and being creative - ICT helps me to do this in an  inspirational and fresh way.</p> <p>I am currently studying for a MA in Professional Development and have  chosen to research the effects of Nintendo DS Lites and Dr Kawashima&#39;s  Brain Training. This research has been fascinating and the ultimate  reflective practice; I would love to share my findings with other  professionals.</p> <p><strong>Janet Chapman</strong><a href="mailto:jchapman@central.towerhamlets.sch.uk"></a></p> <p>I am passionate about E-learning and Web 2.0. I work 4 days a week in  a secondary school overseeing ICT and E-learning, together with  International Links, transition and parents, as well as a host of other  issues, all of which that can be facilitated and improved by the  creative use of ICT.</p> <p>1 day a week I am on secondment to my LA as Innovation Manager, helping with ICT BSF implementation.</p> <p><strong>Angela Cooke</strong><a href="mailto:angela.cooke@education.tas.gov.au"></a></p> <p>I manage the delivery of online extension and challenge programs for  highly able / gifted students around the state.  I deliver professional  learning in online learning and support Quest Atlantis in the state,  while running my own groups in Quest.</p> <p><strong>Derrel Fincher</strong><a href="mailto:derrel@fincher.com"></a></p> <p>I am the Director of Information and Communication Technology at  Graded - The American School of S&atilde;o Paulo. I am currently working on my  dissertation for an Ed.D. in educational technology, with the topic  being research on the communities of practice that form in international  schools. My passion is understanding learning and how to create  conditions that help people learn, whether it is learning by adults or  by children. I am working with our teachers to implement a 1:1 program  in the school, with our pilot in sixth grade (11 year olds). We have  thrown out traditional school control of the laptops and asked students  to bring whatever they own. Our goal is to do all of our work &quot;in the  cloud&quot; or use only open source software. When we espouse teaching in a  student-centred classroom, what does that really mean? When we espouse  preparing our students for their future, what does that really man? Our  pilot teachers, already well-versed in using technology tools with their  students, are making discoveries every day--and finding their comfort  zones challenged. I&#39;m finding my comfort zones challenged as we work  through the issues: finding time for teachers to talk; figuring out how  to bring in those teachers who are on the periphery of the practice;  negotiating meaning with administrators, parents, and teachers; and,  always, wondering if we are doing enough and if we are doing more good  than harm.</p> <p><strong>Joyce Gikandi</strong><a href="mailto:wagitash@gmail.com"></a></p> <p>I am a Kenyan and a member of faculty at Pwani University College,  Kenya. Currently I am pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of Canterbury  in New Zealand. My current research is about effective application of  formative assessment in online learning environments and how it can  enhance ICT education for teachers.</p> <p>My interest in ICT education emerged in the course of my practice as a  teacher in the field of Information Technology, and ICT literacy in a  range of programmes including teacher education, Agriculture and science  Education at tertiary level.</p> <p>My core areas of interests include Educational digital technologies, ICT education for teachers and online learning.</p> <p>I am passionate about sharing experiences particularly in relation to  effective integration of ICT into teaching and learning with other  colleagues who share the same vision around the world.</p> <p><strong>Catherine Gormley</strong><a href="mailto:c.gormley@rsc-ni.ac.uk"></a></p> <p>I am currently an e-learning adviser with JISC RSC-ni <a href="http://www.rsc-ni.ac.uk/">http://www.rsc-ni.ac.uk</a>. Our remit is to embed technology enhanced learning in the FE Colleges we support in Northern Ireland and the 2 HEIs.</p> <p>At present, I am involved in supporting both the Curriculum and HE areas</p> <p>I was formerly an ILT Champion and ILT Champion Curriculum Manager in  an FE College in Northern Ireland. I have also undertaken consultancy  work for a regulatory authority as a lead researcher and I have also  completed an Action Research Project for another support organisation in  FE.</p> <p><strong>Rob Newcombe</strong><a href="mailto:rob6@newcombe6.fsworld.co.uk"></a></p> <p>Microsoft Certified Trainer<br /> Qualified Teacher Status (Secondary Science)<br /> e-Learning Manager and VLE specialist (Particularly FRONTER)<br /> Becta Award runner-up 2004 (Teaching Post 16)</p> <p>Specialties:</p> <p>MCSE, MCSA, MCDST in Server 2003 Virtual Learning Environments:  Fronter, Learnwise, Blackboard Paperless Portfolio Systems: ENVQ Problem  Solver, Innovator.</p> <p><strong>Sue Parkes</strong><a href="mailto:sue-parkes@xtra.co.nz"></a></p> <p>I have just attended a presentation with Christina Preston, here  &quot;down under&quot; in Christchurch, NZ. She invited us to join the MirandaNet!  My mind is buzzing with the collaborative mapping concept. I have been a  huge fan of brainstorms/concept maps in my classroom.</p> <p>Currently studying for a Masters paper in &quot;Best Practice in Online  Teaching and Learning&quot; to improve my academic understanding of online  learning as well as increasing my skills with practical applications. My  next assignment, I am going to use Collaborative mapping concept.</p> <p>I teach in a multicultural secondary school; Hornby High School,  which is located on the south side of Christchurch, here in beautiful  New Zealand. My teaching subjects include Home economics and in the  Learning Area Technology through the contexts of food and textiles. it  is time for me to embed (e-learning hybrid model) more ICT in my day to  day teaching. My school is beginning to make a significant move in using  ICT tools in the classroom for a variety but obvious reasons. Some of  us are more enthusiastic.</p> <p>Our kids use a variety of technology tools eg cellphones, computers,  I-pods etc they have a range of skills and knowledge that we don&#39;t  utilise. To engage 21st century kids this is just another methodology to  engage them and to increase academic performance etc and increase NZ&#39;s  GNP.</p> <p><strong>Ariellah Rosenberg</strong><a href="mailto:rariellah@gmail.com"></a></p> <p>I work at ORT SA, Educational and vocational NGO based in South  Africa, Johannesburg. Heading the Educators Empowerment division which  specialises in Teachers&#39; professional Development (in the areas of Math,  Science and Technology). Big believer and driver of the use of ICT in  your own development and in integration in teaching.

I have mostly taught senior and middle school students and am  currently enrolled on the CIE Diploma in Teaching with ICT programme. I  have been on many in service professional development courses but with  DTWICT I have the opportunity to connect all my learning with technology  and that has made teaching quite an adventure.</p> <p><strong>Oleksiy Stepanovskiy</strong><a href="mailto:astepanovsky@stellasystems.com"></a></p> <p>I am very much interested in promoting 21st century literacies in my  home country and all over the world. Our educational systems need to be  improved so that every person has an opportunity for personal and  professional growth, and we all together as the humanity are able to  solve global problems we are facing.</p> <p><strong>Dimitra Theodosiadou</strong><a href="mailto:demiantheo@gmail.com"></a></p> <p>I am a primary school teacher and I work for almost 12 years. My home  town and work are located in northern Greece. Throughout my school  experience I came across with various problems and difficulties as  regards children&rsquo;s behaviour, interest in learning and management of  special abilities.</p> <p>Additionally, though I take that cooperation and good relation among  co-working teachers is of high importance in our profession, as it is  for every job, it occurs to me that this is not always easy to achieve.  So, I try to find ways to coop with both pupils and other teachers as  well.</p> <p>Within my class, every school year, besides the curriculum lessons, I  try to implement various activities and educational programs such as  environmental programs, health and socializing activities, art and  culture familiarization.</p> <p>My work field calls for me knowing and teaching a variety of lessons  for children 6 to 12 years of age. Every year I have a new class and I  teach all the respective lessons, that is Greek language and grammar,  maths, geography, history, physics, civics, drawing. It is inevitable  that sometimes all this accumulation of work seems quite wearing but  most of the time gives me great satisfaction.</p> <p><strong>Kate Tyrwhitt</strong><a href="mailto:arka88@ozemail.com.au"></a></p> <p>I am interested in being a MirandaNet member after I presented at the  ACEC conference in Melbourne 2010. I was encouraged to join by Dr  Christina Preston after she heard my presentation; &ldquo;Blogs and wikis  capturing creativity in diverse classrooms&rdquo;. I utilise blogs and wikis  to create an online learning environment for the students at the primary  schools I have worked at. Currently I am at St Michael&rsquo;s College in  South Australia and run an Art wiki to programme year 3-7 art and  showcase students&rsquo; work. <a href="http://artsmc.wikispaces.com/">http://artsmc.wikispaces.com</a>. Last year I ran an Eco Design wiki for the year 6 boys at my current school. <a href="http://ecodesignerssmc.wikispaces.com/">http://ecodesignerssmc.wikispaces.com</a>  I have developed an educational blog and used it for PD refection as  well as creating class room blogs that are maintained by me. One of the  public pages is the Year 2/3KT page: <a href="http://kateteaching.edublogs.org/">http://kateteaching.edublogs.org</a></p> <p>An educational blog and wiki can support students with diverse needs.  Blogs and wikis provide a platform for teachers to personalise their  curriculum and deliver differentiated learning. By having the ability to  contribute their own ideas the students&#39; ownership of the blog and wiki  is significant and gives them an audience and purposeful learning  opportunities. By sharing their work in the digital realm their  engagement in all learning areas is magnified and relevant to today&#39;s  learning.  I am interested in the MirandaNet Braided Learning E-Journal  and becoming a World E-Citizen if accepted.</p> <h3>Members</h3> <p><strong>Betina Dimai</strong><a href="mailto:bettina.dimai@uibk.ac.at"></a></p> <p>I am a research and teaching assistant for the business education at  the University of Innsbruck... and ICT is part of my teaching and  research.</p> <p><strong>Lubna Shaheen</strong><a href="mailto:lubnaguj@yahoo.com"></a></p> <p>I&rsquo;m teaching science in BSS form the last 7 years.
