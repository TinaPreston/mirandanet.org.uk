<p><strong>November 2010 Membership Update</strong></p>
<h2>MirandaNet&rsquo;s International Strength</h2>
<p>As you will see from the list below, we have professionals with    some very interesting profiles joining the MirandaNet Fellowship. We  have   over seven hundred members in around seventy countries. Our voice  is being   heard. In the summer, I drew together our debates on  Mirandalink to write an   article about the demise of Becta that has  been widely distributed in government   circles. Geoff Scott Baker and a  team of volunteers also worked on a reply   to The Royal Society about  the current position of ICT in Education that makes   good reading as  well. Both articles are available to members: simply log at the <a href="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/cgi-bin/members.pl?status=checklogon">Members Log on</a> link, and follow the link to the "members only file vault".   The same  page allows you access to the MirandaLink Archive, and this ia also    where you can update your profile.</p>
<p>If you have a   topic that needs attention please start a debate that  is designed to draw knowledge   and support from our diverse  membership. Our greatest strength is our international reach.</p>
<h3>Meeting other members face to face</h3>
<p>Your next chance to meet members face to face and set up joint  projects is   at BETT11 in Olympia. London &ndash; 12th - 15th January.   Join  us on stand, S97, to debate the changing status of teachers in the  digital world. This year, in partnership with DFE advisers and Bedford  University, our topics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>establishing communities of practice for teachers (Wednesday: 1600);</li>
<li>independent learning strategies for students (Thursday: 1600);</li>
<li>and using formative and summative assessment wisely (Friday: 1600).</li>
</ul>
<p>On Saturday we have an Open House @ BETT, World Ecitizens workshop  where teachers can meet colleagues to plan international projects.</p>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="http://www.bettshow.com/">BETT Website</a> - you will be surprised how many MirandaNetters   feature on it in one way or another! More news in the next newsletter.</p>
<h3>MirandaNet Fellowships</h3>
<p>If you are studying for your masters or your doctorate as many  members are   why not publish your research ideas for our membership and  gain a Fellowship.   There is some information about the different  kinds of membership, including   Fellows, on the <a href="../fellowship/join.htm">Join   MirandaNet</a> page.</p>
<h3>New members</h3>
<p>We had a diverse group of new members joining in October. Please get  in touch with   them directly if their interests marry up with yours.</p>
<p>Pam Smith sums up the MirandaNet approach to the use of digital  technologies   in education: my interest in ICT and education is not  about whizz bang gizmos   but is about its huge potential to support and  facilitate learning and development   of organisations through people;  ICT is a vehicle not an end product which   is just as well with the  pace of technological change!</p>
<p>Sharmaine Sharusan also has some strong views on the value of digital  technologies:     I am a techno-optimist; I believe in the promise of  technology to make our     lives easier and freer. Two new members are  looking for support in their   responsibility for ICT in school: Emma  Conlisk, Jeremy Meades.</p>
<p>Panayiotis Tsakalis is one new member who joined as a result of the  highly   successful MirandaMod in Korinthos in September where Theo  Keuchel and Leon   Cych joined me. There were over fifty participants in  the conference room and   a similar number joined on line. You will  find all the resources, edited by   Leon, on this url. Panayiotis  Tsakalis says: reflecting on the comment of a   colleague mentioned  during the MirandaMod in Korinthos, Greece, I&rsquo; d   like to share with  you that I am not a pure ICT native but I don&rsquo;t feel   neither an ICT  immigrant. I feel like a first generation ICT citizen, trying   to form  my ICT identity which others can easily tell (I might have a funny   ICT  accent, like my English one), but I have promised myself that I will do    my best so that my children (meaning my students) will be fully  incorporated   in the ICT society and they will be and function as equal  members of the ICT   natives community! Tharrenos Bratitsis; Vassilios  Dagdilelis; Yannis Dimitriadis;   and, Efstratia Liakopoulou have also  joined as a result of this MirandaMod.   We are delighted to have them  with us and hope some will be successful in obtaining   EU funding to  attend BETT11 to talk to other members about joint projects.</p>
<p>Marie Joubert, who works on the EU Stellar project at Bristol  University,   explains her Ph.D. research that took place authentic  mathematics classrooms   in which computers were used by the pupils to  complete mathematical tasks,   and the research focused on the  meditational role of the teacher, the task   and the computer. Caroline  Windrum is also interested in researching into ICT   in Learning.  Jennifer Ollis, from the US, asks some challenging questions of   ICT  professional that emanate from her research that will make a good  mirandalink   debate.</p>
<p>Best wishes to you al</p>

<p><strong>Tharrenos Bratitsis</strong></p>
<p>I was born in Rhodes, Greece. I completed my studies at the  Electrical Engineers   and Computer Science department of the  Polytechnic School of the University   of Patras on November 1994.  Between 1997 until 2009 when I was a Computer Scientist   and Network  Administrator in various Universities, I participated in several    research and technical projects. My Ph.D. thesis is: Development of  flexible   supporting tools for asynchronous discussions, via analysis  of interactions   among participants, for technology enhanced learning  (2007)</p>
<p>Since 2009 I have been a Lecturer at the <a href="http://www.nured.uowm.gr/">Department of Early Childhood Education</a> of the <a href="http://www.uowm.gr/">University of Western Macedonia</a>,     located in Florina, Greece. I teach courses related to the "ICTs in     education" research   area.</p>
<p>My main research area of expertise is that of Interaction Analysis.</p>
<p>Since I have an engineering background (undergraduate studies) as  well as   an educational background (Doctorate thesis), my research  interests' spectrum   is relatively wide. My main interests are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interaction Analysis</li>
<li>Computer Supported Collaborative Learning</li>
<li>Technology Enhanced Learning</li>
<li>Distance Learning</li>
<li>Educational Software (design and development)</li>
<li>Web 2.0 &amp; applications     in educational settings</li>
<li>ICTs in Education</li>
<li>System architecture and design</li>
<li>Network applications</li>
<li>Network security</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rodger Carroll</strong></p>
<p>As a qualified carpenter and joiner progressing to a registered  building practitioner   in residential and commercial construction I  have been heavily involved in   the building industry for 23 years  including design and administration of projects   and until 1998 when I  commenced teaching courses at all levels with Chisholm   Institute. My  current position is Department Manager, Building and Furniture.</p>
<p>I regularly undertake further training and study and actively  participate   in professional networks to keep my skills and knowledge  up to date. I recently   completed a Masters of Education at Victoria  University. I am current Programs   Director and a past President of the  International Society for Performance   Improvement (ISPI) Melbourne  chapter. Other qualifications include Certificate   IV in TAA, Diploma  of VET (Chisholm), Graduate Certificate of Educational Leadership    (Victoria University), Graduate of the Chair Academy (USA), Certificate  of   Elearning design and facilitation (RMIT).</p>
<p>I have a strong personal commitment to innovative teaching and  flexible learning   methods and believe learning is everywhere, no  matter where you are. All staff   are encouraged to design learning for  the learner and the Industry the learner   will be involved in. This  customisation has resulted in substantial industry   accolade and growth  in our Building &amp; Construction programs.</p>
<p>My research in education in the Building and Construction Industry  has led   to many presentations to local, National and International  events.</p>
<p><strong>Emma Conlisk</strong></p>
<p>I'm Emma and I've been the ICT co-ordinator at our school since 2007  when   I was the only person who was prepared to take it on! Although  it's not(my   speciality and I have no training as such I do love a  challenge and that it   has certainly been! From writing new policies  and setting up a whole new VLE   the last few years have been really  interesting and I am constantly amazed   and intrigued by the new  technology being brought out all of the time and am   always looking for  new ways that it can be used in the classroom...if only   there was an  endless pot of money! I look around at school and see how confident    our children are and only wish there was a way of sharing that youthful  enthusiasm   with the staff! I am really looking forward to reading a  great deal more about   ICT and hope to be able to contribute in the  future!</p>
<p><strong>Vassilios Dagdilelis</strong></p>
<p>My personal research Interests are about Educational Applications of  Information   Technology, especially about Distance Learning and Digital  Literacy.</p>
<p><strong>Yannis Dimitriadis</strong></p>
<p>I am professor of Telematics engineering at the University of  Valladolid,   Spain and I coordinate the transdisciplinary research  group GSIC/EMIC that   focuses on Computer Supported Collaborative  Learning (CSCL). My current research   interests deal with the support  of teachers in orchestrating CSCL classrooms,   through tools, patterns  and systems.</p>
<p><strong>Marie Joubert</strong></p>
<p>I began my professional life as a teacher of mathematics and  computing. I   became involved in writing materials to support teachers  in the use of ICT   within subject teaching: for example, the &lsquo;NOF&rsquo;  teacher education   initiative, a series of DfEE-funded professional  development modules focusing   on the use of ICT in the teaching and  learning of primary mathematics and a   resource for teachers of  mathematics at KS3.</p>
<p>I completed a PhD at the University of Bristol. My research took  place authentic   mathematics classrooms in which computers were used by  the pupils to complete   mathematical tasks, and the research focused  on the meditational role of the   teacher, the task and the computer.</p>
<p>I work at the University of Bristol as a researcher and have been  involved   in a number of research projects concerning the use of ICT in  teaching and   learning, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The InterActive Education project (<a href="http://www.interactiveeducation.ac.uk/">www.interactiveeducation.ac.uk</a>)</li>
<li>Using       handheld computing devices in secondary schools</li>
<li>Using online discussion boards         in science classrooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>I work on the EU-funded Network of Excellence, STELLAR (<a href="http://www.stellarnet.eu/">www.stellarnet.eu</a>)    which aims to address the fragmentation within the Technology  Enhanced Learning   (TEL) research community and to contribute to  developing the research agenda   in this area.</p>
<p><strong>Efstratia Liakopoulou</strong></p>
<p>I work as an ICT teacher in Experimental High School of Tripolis,  Greece.   I am interested in ICT teaching, project work, web 2.0,  e-learning, getting   familiar with new ICT tools and educational  practices, motivating students,   creative teaching,  collaboration/communication with European teachers, participating   in  European projects etc. I am also interested in gender issues, equal  opportunities,   educational policy &amp; school management.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Meades</strong></p>
<p>After teaching for over 13 years     and then responsible for ICT  Strategy in a successful secondary school in   the south-east, I became a  Director of         ICT Strategy and e-Learning at SchoolsICT.</p>
<p>My role and principal interest lies in supporting both schools and  teachers   as they seek to embed ICT in teaching and learning.  Supporting schools from   a strategic perspective using evaluations to  developing strategic plans is   part of my interest but also working  with teachers to help them evolve their   pedagogy and embed the use of  ICT in their teaching. My aim is to align a teacher's   ICT skill set  that will meet their students' needs and expectations - to bring    together a shared approach to learning that involves both collaboration  and   facilitation.</p>
<p>Principally, my work revolves around the use of learning platforms to  provide   an environment that extends the classroom experience and  enables collaborative,   interactive and shared learning.</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Ollis</strong></p>
<p>I am interested in emerging technologies and their impact on  education such   as smartphones, wikis, twitter, iPads, etc&hellip;. More  specifically I am curious   as to how open teachers and administrators  are to integrating these technologies   into their curriculum at the  middle and high school level. I am currently working   on my thesis in  Science Education at Florida State University. My project will   attempt  to describe teacher and administrator attitudes/beliefs towards Web    2.0 technologies by conducting a survey. Some questions I would like to  explore:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are educators willing to use emerging technologies to support  student     centred learning? (Technology is often integrated if it  supports a teacher     centred       model i.e. online grade books, LCD  projectors, PowerPoint, etc&hellip;)</li>
<li>How open are educators to adapt their curriculum to new technologies?</li>
<li>Is there a correlation between educator age (years of service)  and openness       to applying emerging technologies in the classroom?</li>
<li>Are educators willing to learn about technology from their  students?     (Are digital immigrants willing to learn from digital  natives?)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sharmaine Sharusan</strong></p>
<p>I am a techno-optimist; I believe in the promise of technology to  make our   lives easier and freer. I am working on my doctorate in  Educational Technology   and am always interested in the ways we can  reach global learners.</p>
<p><strong>Pam Smith</strong></p>
<p>My interest in ICT and Education is not     about whizz bang gizmos  but is about its huge potential to support and facilitate     learning  and development of       organisations through people; ICT is a vehicle  not an end product which   is just as well with the pace of  technological change! I have a particular   interest       in the ways  in which ICT can remove barriers to learning. My perspective       on  learning is that the process should not be and is not restricted to    'children and young people'. The most exciting dynamics come from  everyone   in the organisation       learning together; a concept to  which I am deeply committed as a professional       trainer and coach.  There are huge overlaps between the respective roles   of ICT and  Equality and Diversity; this drives my passion. I shock myself by        using passion and technology in the same sentence as I used to perceive    myself       as a not so closet luddite but the very real potential of  ICT to positively       affect life chances has brought me to forums  such as MirandaNet.</p>
<p><strong>Panayiotis Tsakalis</strong></p>
<p>Since I was a student teacher (from 1991 to 1995, a period that  internet connection   was a scarce phenomenon in Greece, even at  Universities) I was completely amazed   by the power of New Technologies  (as ICT were mentioned at that time) in making   science generally and  in teaching especially!</p>
<p>In the following years and during my postgraduate studies in  Philosophy of   Science (especially Cognitive Science and Philosophy of  Psychology) and my   Ph.D. studies in Educational Psychology, not only I  used ICT (software and   hardware) for my scientific work and research,  but I also attended educational   programs and seminars on ICT, I  educated pupils, students and adults in ICT,   I co-worked on projects  aimed at the development of ICT educational applications   and I did  research on the benefits of ICT in teaching.</p>
<p>The last three years that I work mainly as a primary school teacher, I  encourage   my students to utilize ICT in classroom almost every day,  even though technical   problems, funding and resisting ideologies in  Greek schools make it difficult   sometimes. I have also created a  personal blog, though it is not very active   yet!</p>
<p>Currently, I have been working on a paper about the effectiveness of  open   and distance educational programs based on Web 2.0 technologies  under the recommendations   of the self-regulated learning theory  addressed to disabled or disadvantaged   learners.</p>
<p>Finally, after having discovered the amazing world of web 2.0 (I am  not a   Facebook fun, so it took me a little longer to realize and  appreciate the presence   of social software), my 16 10-years-old pupils  and I work on two e-twinning   projects, in electronic collaboration  with at least 30 other parties from 25   different countries, and I am  about to prepare a Comenius project about the   use of ICT (creating  comics using paper, crayons or clay, multiple photographs,   a movie  maker etc) in order to promote creativity and student involvement,   in  learning (probably) history (for example, we may create a movie about a    battle, or the roman conquests, or a chapter of Homer&rsquo;s Iliad using  student-made   comics).</p>
<p>Reflecting the comment of a colleague mentioned during the MirandaMod  in Korinthos,   Greece, I&rsquo;d like to share with you that I am not a pure  ICT native but   I don&rsquo;t feel neither an ICT immigrant. I feel like a  first generation   ICT citizen, trying to form my ICT identity which  others can easily tell (I   might have a funny ICT accent, like my  English one), but I have promised myself   that I will do my best so  that my children (meaning my students) will be fully   incorporated in  the ICT society and they will be and function as equal members   of the  ICT natives community!</p>
