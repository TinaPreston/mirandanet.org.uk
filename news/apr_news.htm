  <h2>April 2000</h2>
  <p>Before you start - I know this is late - yet again. Unfortunately I was away 
    for the whole Easter break - no computing at all. Instead I revisited my favourite 
    bits of Yorkshire and took some photos to update my web site (poser). I also 
    drove the school minibus and shivered in a damp tent so not all fun....</p>
  <h3>Jane's Bit</h3>
  <h4>Think.com</h4>
  <p>The main news is that while you are all enjoying the Bank Holiday Sunshine, 
    Scoop is going to metamorphose into Think. I came up with the strapline 'I 
    Think.com, therefore I Can', but the management team said, 'Eurgh' (or something 
    of the sort). I thought it was intellectually playful.</p>
  <p>When you next log in, go to <a href="http://www.think.com/">http://www.think.com</a>. 
    The link on the MirandaNet front page has now changed.</p>
  <p>Don't worry: all your articles, images, etc. will still be there, and the 
    log-in names and passwords will be the same as before. If you have forgotten 
    what your ID is (and I emailed the full list on 2 May) then you can look it 
    up on an unlinked page at:<br>
    www.mirandanet.org.uk/Scoop/login.htm</p>
  <p>Your email address will now be <a href="mailto:your_name@think.com">your_name@think.com</a>. 
    It will look slightly different and you will have some choice about colour-scheme 
    preferences.</p>
  <p>The basic concept has changed - you now have your own Gallery where you store 
    work-in-progress as well as finished work and you can choose to publish to 
    the world at large or to invited members. The main new features and some tips 
    on how to weather the change-over are at: www.mirandanet.org.uk/Scoop/thinktips.htm</p>
  <p>Print them out before you log on.</p>
  <p>The MirandaRose Awards have reached their first birthday - we have been looking 
    at educational sites for a year now and giving the awards to those we have 
    felt make a distinctive mark. Some people have asked what our judging criteria 
    are. Sometimes it's a case of, 'We know it when we see it', but if any Mirandanetters 
    want to offer suggestions for Awardees, look at the selection criteria on 
    <a href="../resources/criteria.htm">www.mirandanet.org.uk/links/criteria.htm</a></p>
  <p>The April Educational-site-of-the-Month has been awarded to Orbital Mechanics 
    Education Network - Educational opportunities for UK National Curriculum Keystages 
    2 to 5 in Science, Technology, Design, Mathematics, Geography, Art, English 
    and History <a href="http://homepages.nildram.co.uk/~omen/">homepages.nildram.co.uk/~omen/</a></p>
  <p>The Community-site-of-the-Month MirandaRose Award goes to Parents online 
    - a very good, informative and imaginative site designed for parents, with 
    hints on how to help with homework in many different disciplines <a href="http://www.parents.org.uk/">www.parents.org.uk</a></p>
  <p>And, as always, there are the new month's links at<a
href="../resources/links.htm">www.mirandanet.org.uk/links/links.htm</a></p>
  <p>The Summary and Forward only of Preston, C., Cox M. and Cox K. (April 2000) 
    Teachers as Innovators in Learning: What motivates teachers to use ICT is 
    now online at <a
href="../publications/index.html">www.mirandanet.org.uk/publications/ </a>and you can click from there to ordering 
    information.</p>
  <p>The book published by the Teacher Training Agency/MirandaNet/Oracle/Compaq</p>
  <p>Also online are details of a seminar on Saturday 24th June:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Seminar: Rethinking Literacy in an Age of New Media</li>
    <li>Venue: Froebel College, University of Surrey, Roehampton</li>
    <li>Time: 9.30 a.m. - 6 p.m.</li>
    <li>Organiser: See conference website: <a href="http://www.cyberangle.demon.co.uk/">www.cyberangle.demon.co.uk</a></li>
    <li>Audience: Those concerned to map the future of literacy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We live in a changing world but are our notions of what it means to be literate 
    keeping up with these changes? What does literacy mean today and what will 
    it mean as the century advances? This conference will critically examine the 
    ways in which we define literacy and the role of literature, film, television 
    and information technology in the development of children's imagination and 
    creativity.</p>
  <p>Speakers include several MirandaNet Fellows.</p>
  <p>Contact: 'Rethinking Literacy' 49 Eastbourne Avenue, London, W3 6JS or 020
    8932 2696 or 0779 029 9242; Email: wearle at dircon.co.uk</p>
  <p>... and on a personal note</p>
  <p>There was nothing from me last time because I was in Japan. There are some 
    things they do better there. So I'm one of the converted. Lawrence and I are 
    planning to bring you some live drama links to Japan. It won't be kabuki theatre 
    ... but watch this space for further announcements.</p>
  <p>BECTA does some good stuff! - English and maths specialists please note the 
    following</p>
  <p>Becta is looking for examples of good practice in the use of ICT with English.
    Becta will pay for one day's cover for each case study used. Publication
    is
    likely to be via the Virtual Teacher Centre on the National Grid for Learning.
    More information can be obtained from jane_spilsbury at becta.org.uk.</p>
  <p>A national competition to help primary school children develop mathematics 
    skills has been launched by Becta to support the Government's Maths Year 2000 
    initiative. For full details on the competition, please see: <a
href="http://mathschallenge.ngfl.becta.org.uk">mathschallenge.ngfl.becta.org.uk</a></p>
  <p>From Tina - an interesting site for the aid of stress reduction.....</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.gardenersworld.beeb.com/">www.gardenersworld.beeb.com</a></p>
  <p>It is a fascinating site for all gardeners and probably fits into the national 
    curriculum somewhere</p>
  <h3>Tina strikes again - wha hae!</h3>
  <p>A bit of culture for you to enjoy from saucers close to the prime minister! 
    Tony Blair is being shown around a hospital.Towards the end of his visit, 
    he is shown into a ward with a number of people with no obvious signs of injury. 
    He goes to greet the first and the chap replies:</p>
  <blockquote>&quot;FAIR fa' your honest sonsie face,<br>
    Great chieftain e' the puddin'.race! Aboon them a' ye tak your place,<br>
    Painch, tripe, or thairm:<br>
    Weel are ye wordy o' a grace<br>
    As lang 's my arm.&quot;</blockquote>
  <p>Tony, being somewhat confused (easily done) goes to the next patient and 
    greets him. He replies:</p>
  <blockquote>&quot;Some hae meat, and canna eat,<br>
    And some wad eat that want it,<br>
    But we hae meat and we can eat,<br>
    And sae the Lord be thankit.&quot;</blockquote>
  <p>The third starts rattling off as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>&quot;Wee sleekit, cow'rin, tim'rous beastie, O, what a panic's 
    in thy breastie!<br>
    Thou need na start awa sae hasty,<br>
    Wi bickering brattle!<br>
    I wad be laith to rin an chase thee, Wi murdering pattle!&quot;</blockquote>
  <p>Tony turns to the doctor accompanying him and asks what sort of ward this 
    is. A mental ward?</p>
  <p><em>&quot;No,&quot;</em> replies the doctor, <em>&quot;It's the Burns unit.&quot;</em></p>
