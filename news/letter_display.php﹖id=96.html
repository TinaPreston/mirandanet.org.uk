<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Looking back on 2010 in this newsletter there are several items about the arrangements    that are being made for the UK professional organisations to take over the Becta    assets. The Becta website will be archived on 31st January and this UK government    agency will close finally in March 2011. This transfer process is not complete    yet. The MirandaNet view about what should be saved from the Becta services    can be found in the article "<a href="../ftp/members/Axing%20of%20Becta.doc">The    Axing of Becta</a>". Please use this to influence policy makers where you    can. The repercussions will be felt throughout this coming decade as the professional    organisations fight to be heard by the politicians. ITTE, Naace and MirandaNet    wrote jointly to Michael Gove in June - but neither he nor his representatives    have shown any enthusiasm to meet us yet.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2011 there is an even greater need than usual to club together.    I have listed the conferences where MirandaNetters will be represented either    running MirandaMods or presenting papers. You can engage in this kind of Continuing    Professional Development about the issues that impact on the use of digital    technologies in learning in London, Birmingham, Manchester in the UK and Bremen    in Germany either by attending the event or by engaging from home online. In    summarising these 2011 conferences about digital technologies and education    I notice how mature the conference topics seem to be. Delegates are asked to    consider the disruptive role of technologies in today&rsquo;s society; their    impact on pedagogy and on the status of teachers; the effect of mobile technologies    in crossing boundaries in convergent environments; and, the sustainability of    technological development in education in a European and US recession. Some    of our members will also be interested in debating how research can influence    stakeholder in this field and balancing the need for accountability against    the tendency to create too much red tape and stifle intuition. There must be    a conference that appeals to you in this list. I look forward to seeing you    there.</p>
<p>I wish you all a happy New Year</p>
<p>Christina Preston<a href="mailto:christina@mirandanet.ac.uk"></a></p>
<h3>Two invitations to MirandaNetters</h3>
<p><strong>BETT11 Events</strong><br /> The MirandaNet Fellowship, often called the Facebook of international ICT professionals,    is now invited to debate the changing status of teachers in the digital world.    Join us on stand, S97 in the Grand Hall, to or join us online. This year, in    partnership with DfE advisers and the University of Bedfordshire, our topics    are: establishing communities of practice for teachers (Wednesday: 15:30); independent    learning strategies for students (Thursday: 15:30); and using formative and    summative assessment wisely (Friday: 15:30). On Saturday 15th January we have    an Open House @ BETT World Ecitizens workshop where MirandaNetters and their    guests can meet other colleagues from Australia, The Netherlands, India and    the Czech Republic to plan international projects. See our full programme on:    <a href="../bett/index.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/bett</a></p>
<p>New Fellows should let me know if they can attend as we can award your certificates    at BETT11.</p>
<p><strong>Be a partner in our EU proposal</strong><br /> If your university or school would like to be a partner in our sixth framework    EU project proposal please get in touch with John Cuthell who is masterminding    our bid. This has to be in by mid-February. Our World Ecitizens workshop on    15th January at BETT11 (<a href="../bett/index.html">details    on the website</a>) is an opportunity to meet potential partners - but even    if you cannot attend face to face or online send your details to John and he    will explain what you need to do to join in.</p>
<h3>Becta Research Publications</h3>
<p>MirandaNet members who were involved as co-researchers in three Becta research    reports in 2010 might want to know when they will be published. These publications    are finished but have been held up because of the demise of Becta. The main    authors are still negotiating ownership, but we hope they will soon be published    on the MirandaNet, WLE centre and Outstream websites. These are the draft titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pachler N, Preston C, Cuthell J and Allen A (2010 in press) The ICT CPD      Landscape in England. Becta, Coventry</li>
<li>Allen A, Preston C, Payton M. and Pickering (2010 in press) E-safety guidance      for the FE &amp; Skills Sector. Becta, Coventry</li>
<li>Leask M. and Preston C b(2010 in press) ICT Tools for Future Teachers.      Becta, Coventry.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Becta&rsquo;s ICTRN Network</h3>
<p>The ICT Research Network has always been a free, independent and accessible    resource set up to stimulate the exchange of information, debate and sharing    of best practice. If you are a member of Becta&rsquo;s ICT Research Network    you will have received notice that The Association for Learning Technology (ALT)    in partnership with Naace will be hosting ICT Research Network (ICTRN) on the    ALT server. There is no funding to help in this transfer. This arrangement is    supported by the eLearning Network (ELN), the MirandaNet Fellowship and the    Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education (ITTE). The aim    is that this partnership will ensure that the ICT in education research community    continues to be supported beyond Becta's closure.</p>
<p>Becta is confident that this legacy will continue under the new hosting arrangements.</p>
<p>In the recent ICTRN survey, the retention of ICTRN archive was one of the main    key issues raised for consideration and highlighted by ICTRN members. So the    partnership is pleased to confirm that the ICTRN archives will now be moved    to the new ICT Research Network location (and not the National Archives as previously    advised). The archives will only be accessible to the ICT Research members who    register with the new host. To continue to take advantage of the network you    need to sign up to the new ICTRN mailing list.</p>
<h3>MirandaNetters in Conference 2011</h3>
<p><strong>MirandaMod Programme 2011</strong></p>
<p>So far MirandaMods will be held at four conferences in 2011:</p>
<p><strong>1. MirandaMods at BETT January 2011, London</strong></p>

<p><strong>4. The CAL Conference 2011 - Learning Futures: Education, Technology    &amp; Sustainability April 13-15 2011, Manchester, UK</strong></p>
<p>In 2011, the conference will lead a challenging international debate about    the future of research and practice in educational technology. CAL 11 aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the role of educational technology research in addressing questions      of global and social justice, widening participation and digital democracy</li>
<li>Assess what role educational technology might play in the context of low      carbon, energy constrained futures</li>
<li>Explore how emerging technologies from diverse fields (e.g. gaming, AI,      biotech, ubiquitous computing) might offer new environments for learning</li>
<li>Examine the informal learning practices emerging in children, youth and      adults&rsquo; digital cultures and their implications for education</li>
<li>Reflect on what lessons have been learned over the last thirty years of      education technology research, and what these might mean for the future of      research in the field.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. British Education Research Conference (BERA) Annual Conference    2011, September 6-8, Institute of Education, London</strong></p>
<p>Some members will also be attending this BERA conference that focuses on research    issues which are particularly relevant as research funds are cut in the UK recession.    We are applying to do a MirandaMod.</p>
<p>The two main speakers are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Professor Mary James from the Institute of Education, University    of London</strong><br /> How can we Speak Truth to Power, and be heard? A case for principled pragmatism<br /> BERA has done a great deal to establish mechanisms and infrastructures for its    collective wisdom to be co-ordinated, mined and further developed. A task in    the coming years will be to increase its efforts to put this work to good use    for the benefit of education. Central will be communication and dialogue with    key stakeholders about the relevance of research evidence to policy. But how    should we go about this? Drawing particularly on the experience of TLRP, this    address will explore the diversity of direct and indirect ways in which research    can have impact without compromising fundamental values.</p>
<p><strong>2. Professor Onora O&rsquo;Neill Principal of Newnham College, Cambridge    from 1992-2006 and now Professor Emeritus in the Faculty of Philosophy in Cambridge</strong><br /> Intelligent Accountability in Education <br /> Systems of accountability are second order ways of assessing the standard to    which first order tasks are carried out, for a great variety of purposes. However,    more accountability is not always better, and processes of holding to account    can impose high costs without securing substantial benefits. This can happen    in education, for example if the assessment tail starts to wag the education    dog, or if beautiful lesson plans produce little learning. Teachers and learners,    like others, need to be held to account by intelligent systems of accountability    that do not distort the primary activity, while providing enough &ndash; but    not excessive--evidence of standards achieved to specific audiences for specific    purposes. Intelligent accountability in education, as elsewhere, needs to communicate,    not merely to disseminate, relevant evidence that can be assessed by those to    whom professionals and institutions are accountable in real time.</p>
