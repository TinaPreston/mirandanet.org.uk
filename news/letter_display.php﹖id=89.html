<h3>Stop Press!</h3>
<p>The CAL11 Conference, "Learning Futures: Education, Technology &amp; Sustainability", will be held in Manchester UK, April 13-15 2011. This looks like a valuable conference,and several MirandaNet members have submitted abstracts already. The <strong>deadline </strong>for abstracts for the CALL11 Conference is <strong>this Friday</strong>, October 8th, but the CAL11 organisers are <strong>leaving the website open until Monday</strong> October 11th. You still have time to send in your abstract here: <a href="http://www.elsevierscitech.com/emails/CAL11_conf_deadline.html"><br /> www.elsevierscitech.com/emails/CAL11_conf_deadline.html</a></p>
<p>More information in the conference listing below.</p>
<h3>Face to face and online international MirandaMods 2010/2011</h3>
<p>Dear MirandaNetters,</p>
<p>One of the great strengths of MirandaNet is the way in which members share their professional knowledge and expertise globally. Wherever you are, we hope that in 2010 and 2011 you will continue to debate with other members in our lively MirandaLink discussions and that even more of you will start to join in the MirandaNet version of an &lsquo;unconference&rsquo;, which we call 'MirandaMods'. You can find out more about MirandaMods here: <a href="../mirandamods/index.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/mirandamods</a></p>
<p>We have put together a stimulating programme of twelve online and face to face MirandaMods up until March next year. All the topics for debate listed below take conflicting views on digital technologies in education. If you are interested in the professional knowledge creation theory that underpins MirandaMods, there is a paper on the subject: <a href="../casestudies/254.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/casestudies/mnet/254</a></p>
<p>Even if you cannot join the debates when they take place, we hope you will contribute to the collaborative professional knowledge maps that participants create for each topic. In this way we are developing a growing repository of up-to-date knowledge in areas where learning and teaching issues are undergoing profound changes.</p>
<p>Christina Preston<br /> October 2010</p>
<h3>Organisational details</h3>
<p>The MirandaMods are free and most of the organization is undertaken by members on a voluntary basis. We are always looking out for company sponsorship to cover incidental costs such as refreshments: please get in touch if you know of any company that might like to help us out. We also try to cover a broad selection of topics in these MirandaMods. Is there any topic you would like to see covered? Would you like a MirandaMod to take place in your country? Do let me know.</p>
<h3>Locations and key dates</h3>
<p>The locations for the next MirandaMods and other activities are: London, Birmingham and Manchester. We have already had a MirandaMod in Korinthos, Greece;</p>

<h3>A challenge to members</h3>
<p>MirandaNetters, why not share in our efforts to bring to our members the very latest knowledge about digital technologies in education? You know at least one important part of the jigsaw from your unique perspective. We would really value your participation. The language is English, but we also welcome resources to the collaborative maps that are not necessarily in English. These events tend to have many more &lsquo;lurkers&rsquo; than participants: can we alter the balance?</p>
<p><strong>Support for members participation</strong><br /> If you are planning to travel to BETT11 from abroad and need to apply for funding, we can support your application by writing letters of invitation to members who want to speak at these MirandaMods. We can also supply certificates of participation to those who join in at the face-to-face sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Technical information</strong><br /> Wherever you are you only need broadband access to enter these debates as a participant. All the software is free and so is your participation.</p>
<p><strong>Future developments</strong><br /> We also want to see how MirandaMods might build on the value of collaborative professional learning in a more long-term form in which we professionals use evidence to develop theory. In this context, Dr. Chris Yapp will be inviting members to collaborate in &lsquo;writing&rsquo; a &lsquo;book&rsquo; called provisionally <em>Pervasive Learning: Facing the Challenges of the 21st Century</em>. We do not in fact know what form the outcomes of this collaboration might take and invite you to be part of this experiment. The MirandaMods will be hosted at Bedford University where Professor Marilyn Leask, a Senior MirandaNet Fellow, is now a Dean.</p>

<p>Further information about this conference:</p>
<p><strong>The CAL Conference 2011</strong><br /> Learning Futures: Education, Technology &amp; Sustainability<br /> April 13-15 2011, Manchester, UK</p>
<p>CAL (Computer Assisted Learning) is one of the leading international conferences in the field of education and technology. It brings together researchers across all education sectors, from primary years, to informal learning, to higher education, and across a range of disciplines from psychology to computer science, media and cultural studies.</p>
<p>In 2011, the conference will lead a challenging international debate about the future of research and practice in educational technology. CAL 11 aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the role of educational technology research in addressing questions of global and social justice, widening participation and digital democracy</li>
<li>Assess what role educational technology might play in the context of low carbon, energy constrained futures</li>
<li>Explore how emerging technologies from diverse fields (e.g. gaming, AI, biotech, ubiquitous computing) might offer new environments for learning</li>
<li>Examine the informal learning practices emerging in children, youth and adults&rsquo; digital cultures and their implications for education</li>
<li>Reflect on what lessons have been learned over the last thirty years of education technology research, and what these might mean for the future of research in the field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our four themes for the conference are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theme 1: Sustainability, globalisation and social justice</li>
<li>Theme 2: The future of learning technologies</li>
<li>Theme 3: Informal learning and digital cultures</li>
<li>Theme 4: Looking back to look forward</li>
</ul>
