  <h2>June 2000</h2>
  <p>This time I am going to be on time if it kills me! I spent the half term 
    in Prague, meeting Czech teachers and renewing old friendships and I also 
    managed to spend a fair bit of time looking around the city. This has convinced 
    me that a) I need to go again and b) it must be time we had another MirandaNet 
    conference there! I leave that suggestion before the house. (Oh, and beer 
    is still only 60p a litre....)</p>
  <p>Terry Freedman sent me a copy of his new book and I managed to put aside 
    time to read it. I have actually written a review which you can find at <a
href="../publications/terryreview.htm">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/publications/terryreview.htm</a>. Although 
    I'm not an ICT coordinator myself it seems to me the book contains a lot of 
    useful stuff so have a look at my review.</p>
  <h3>First, as usual...Jane's bit</h3>
  <h4>Site News</h4>
  <p>The MirandaNet site is about to be physically moved to a different server. 
    This means that for a little while certain things will not be working - the 
    search engine is one. And there will be dead links. The reason for this is 
    that we are going to leave the present site as it is while a new one is being 
    designed. It will have a more professional, portal feel to it. Now is the 
    time for anyone to chip in and say what they would like to see on the site. 
    But it does mean that there's going to be an interim summer period when it's 
    all a bit wobbly.</p>
  <p>Watch Mirandalink to see when the new site is launched.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile the front page is a bit different and now tells you what the newest 
    pages are. And there's a new guest book feature so that we can attract new 
    scholars and educators who might want to get involved with the Fellowship, 
    with Think.com and with the forthcoming new mentoring scheme.</p>
  <h4>Think News</h4>
  <p>Improvements are being made to Think.com all the time. So if you haven't 
    looked at it recently, have another browse about. There are a lot of new Help 
    screens which could give you ideas (we'd like to anglicise them, of course, 
    but meanwhile the information is there).</p>
  <p>Do try and post something on the MirandaNet Gazette. Anyone with Reporter 
    rights can do so and we'd like to see much more variety than there is now.</p>
  <h4>Links</h4>
  <p>The June Educational-site-of-the-Month has been awarded to:</p>
  <p>Terra Media - a chronology of the media and an impressive learning and reference 
    resource on audio-visual and communications media for all ages <a href="http://www.terramedia.co.uk/">www.terramedia.co.uk</a></p>
  <p>The Community-site-of-the-Month MirandaRose Award goes to:</p>
  <p>Parents Information Network - apparently 60% of secondary schools report 
    that parents ask questions about ICT; this site helps answer their queries. 
    <a href="http://www.pin.org.uk/">www.pin.org.uk</a></p>
  <p>Both of these site owners have written back to us to say how honoured they 
    are to have been given these awards and have suggested closer links.</p>
  <p>And a happy strawberries-and-cream season to you all from Your Web Editor</p>
  <h3>Onto serious matters....</h3>
  <p>At the seminar on the 5th June we spent some time discussing the stresses 
    affecting the profession at present. this led to two separate threads developing 
    on Mirandalink.</p>
  <p>Thread one concerned the Threshold process. Steve Copley was first in..... 
  </p>
  <p>It took a grand total of 9 hours 45 minutes to complete mine, spread across 
    a number of VERY late nights. Yes it was frustrating, time-consuming, etc, 
    but I think it has been a very useful exercise for me to have done: - It has 
    made me look extremely closely at what I do well and what I am not doing, 
    but maybe should. - It has given me a chance to tell my head all the good 
    things I do (just in case he hadn't noticed!) - It has made me feel good about 
    what I do.</p>
  <p>I know we deserve the pay rise without the hassle, but from what I gather 
    the Treasury wouldn't simply give us the case... A hoop was required for us 
    to jump through so that other public sector employees didn't see us just being 
    given free cash. Such is politics I guess.</p>
  <p>Also, coming from industry prior to teaching, I see nothing wrong with obtaining 
    a pay increase for doing your job well. It is a pretty poor way of proving 
    you do it well, but less subjective than some other ways. No way would be 
    perfect or please everyone.</p>
  <p>Our school has been fantastically efficient in supporting its staff. I have 
    read in the TES about the misinformation some teachers have been fed and we 
    have had none of that at all. Our head and staff support team have provided 
    excellent guidance, support, feedback... Spot on. A chore, yes, but a one-off 
    and a new pay scale at the end of it. Could be a lot worse I say!</p>
  <p>John Meadows then came in with a very different perspective.</p>
  <p>As a teacher educator ( I hate the word trainer, it sounds like a dog trainer!) 
    I am interested in the way that teachers' work is monitored by these new assessors. 
    Has anyone yet had any experience of being observed during lessons, not by 
    Ofsted, but by other teachers/educators, using similar criteria to those on 
    the threshold stuff. We certainly use similar criteria when we observe our 
    student teachers doing practice lessons and also use similar ones for non-QTS 
    teachers on our Registered Teacher Programme. My feeling so far is that this 
    could easily be another serious source of strife, especially if you happen 
    to disagree with the views of the so-called impartial assessor.</p>
  <p>Enter John Potter</p>
  <p>So Mirandanet goes political this week. OK... A couple of points that have 
    been made clear to me in the schools I visit and with which I happen to agree:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Give everyone a pay rise. Teachers with under 7 years experience have 
      also been implementing strategy after strategy (in primary, but look out 
      secondaries here they come). I've got trainee teachers who are excellent 
      practitioners and who have given up other careers in other areas to become 
      teachers. And what are they starting on? One, a parent with a four year 
      old, has been offered a salary of about &pound;19,000 in September.</li>
    <li>According to the TES, the &quot;independent assessors&quot; will look 
      at about 8 applications a day. They will be paid about &pound;375 per day 
      for processing them. Are they required to have actually done the job? What 
      do you think?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>David Fuller next</p>
  <p>If we're on the subject of starting salaries. I became a teacher 10 years 
    ago and was shocked at the poor pay. I was on a high salary at the time Approx 
    &pound;30k with expense account and company car etc. I was not expecting anything 
    like this sort of salary but when offered jobs in schools the pay varied from 
    &pound;13k - &pound;18k. Fortunately I took the plunge and have never regretted 
    the decision since.</p>
  <p>I do have one bugbear with the present system. That is I came in an environment 
    crying out for my skills as an IT professional, but because I simply could 
    not afford to take a year off for a PGCE course (&pound;700 a month mortgage 
    anyone?) I was forced into the only area that would take me - the independent 
    sector. There was no in-house course designed for IT, the closest I could 
    get was D&amp;T and I was not prepared to get in there. I also have managed 
    to successfully complete an MA in Educational Computing, but this still does 
    not make a difference.</p>
  <p>John Potter</p>
  <p>You're right about the money side of it David. A lot of my students go into 
    the most tremendous debt to train in the public sector. Some of them even 
    go on working at night to pay for food and such in the most demanding year 
    of their lives, the PGCE. The training salary next year will help (but there's 
    no promise that it will continue the year after in primary). But for this 
    year's trainees, not only will they start on &pound;19,000. They will be repaying 
    a student and/or hardship loan.</p>
  <p>Robert Ellis</p>
  <p>I welcome any opportunity to reward staff for the huge efforts that they 
    make. In our College we already have a performance management system that 
    (I hope) made it reasonably easy for staff to complete the form.</p>
  <p>My opinion.</p>
  <p>From being a debate about Performance related pay this debate moved very 
    quickly to the fact that starting salaries generally are too low and that 
    everyone needs a boost, not just the &quot;point niners&quot; I think John 
    potter is right - salaries just need raising overall. I suspect that the training 
    salary will not do anything to address the current specialist shortages that 
    are now emerging. (Tried getting a maths teacher lately?) I suspect that a 
    large number of trainees will accept better offers in industry once they have 
    had their years' training. I must also beg to disagree with Steve. I don't 
    think the hoop jumping is to keep the treasury happy, though that might be 
    a side affect. We will see the fruits of its real intent in January when people 
    know whether or not they have crossed the Threshold. Teachers in scools like 
    Bob Ellis's will be okay but for many the cosy staffroom conspiracy to protect 
    the less competent and the ineffectual head teacher are both going to be blown 
    wide open. Teaching will never be the same again. Supporting colleagues because 
    they are a weak link in your team will be a thing of the past. - just call 
    me a cynic if you like and I hope I am wrong but......</p>
  <p>Thread two was all about how hard it is to become a teacher and was started 
    by Maureen Cronin</p>
  <p>On a slightly different, but related note, I graduated with honours with 
    a 4-year double degree in Education and English from a university in the US, 
    got a Fulbright scholarship to study the educational system of South Korea, 
    did a 2-year masters degree in International and Comparative Education at 
    Columbia University in NYC, taught in the state school system of NY for years, 
    and still I have to do a PGCE to become qualified for the state sector in 
    the UK. I don't get it.</p>
  <p>Now I work mostly freelance doing evaluation of educational programmes using 
    ICT and I run INSETs here and there. I miss having my own classroom so much, 
    but I'm committed to state education and can't see myself in the private sector. 
  </p>
  <p>Jet setter John Seward had a possible explanation</p>
  <p>The psychological explanation is UK Government parochialism. The field of 
    education is a sample, not an exception.</p>
  <p>John Potter</p>
  <p>It might interest Maureen and others on the list in the same predicament 
    to know that the TTA is moving towards heavy promotion of a modular PGCE for 
    people who wish to go at different speeds into the profession. To work in 
    the state sector in the UK you need to go through the process of accreditation 
    against the standards published in the curriculum for Initial Teacher Training 
    (the famous 4/98 document, aka High Status, High Standards). These standards, 
    it is now thought by the powers that be, could be broken down, offered in 
    a modular way and sometimes accredited from prior learning. So some people 
    on a modular PGCE may move more quickly than others because they may, for 
    example, have all the ICT knowledge they require. Similarly, for others who 
    wish to qualify more slowly than the mad 38 week PGCE, there would presumably 
    be opportunities to take modules over time. No one yet knows how this would 
    work in practice.</p>
  <p>I personally think it needs a module which links all of the strands together 
    into a learning plan (such as Helen Mitchell has devised for the MA at our 
    uiniversity) and familiarises teachers with the current system. There have 
    been very many changes (and more to come) which would require a steep learning 
    curve in a UK Primary School if you were able to just go in and teach there. 
    I also believe there is still a need to consider pedagogical approaches and 
    theories of teaching and learning (not to mention child development for those 
    colleagues working with younger children). We do face this issue in East London 
    with very many people from different backgrounds wishing for speedier accreditation 
    of prior learning and a different kind of programme of teacher education in 
    order to teach in UK schools. Hopefully, there will one day be an imaginative 
    and flexible approach which allows people to gain the necessary experience 
    or extension to existing experience work in schools. The system certainly 
    needs talented people from all backgrounds.</p>
  <p>John Meadows</p>
  <p>We are also planning a modular PGCE starting in September 2000 - a real pain, 
    because we are trying to fit it into our regular PGCE - square pegs and round 
    holes!</p>
  <p>Tony Fisher</p>
  <p>We too (at Univ of Nottingham) are offering a modular PGCE to begin in Sept. 
    - current state of play is quite a lot of interest but somewhat slow on firm 
    applications.</p>
  <p>John Cuthell - following on from a brief discussion of an appropriate name 
    for this thread.</p>
  <p>That's right. Why bother as in &quot;Why bother?&quot; I wouldn't contemplate 
    going into teaching these days. It's too much like that scene from 'Metropolis' 
    - and there was a time when we thought that it would only happen to the kids 
    we taught... So it goes. It's better than working in a call centre, though, 
    which is the only option that a lot of graduates seem to have. I mean, it 
    is a part-time job, and there are long holidays, and it is convenient (minimum 
    child-care costs, and so on.) So it stands to reason, dunnit?</p>
  <p>Sue Heightman</p>
  <p>In all this debate about the threshold and the point of going into teaching, 
    no one has talked about learning. When applicants are asked about why they 
    want to go into medicine, the interviewers are always looking for the answer 
    that the applicant is intellectually curious about disease and injury and 
    how to cure or control it. There is only one good reason for going into teaching 
    surely and that is that you are fascinated by learning and how people, including 
    yourself can learn more effectively. Everything then becomes bearable - even 
    the threshold-if you keep on learning yourself and you genuinely care about 
    the real learning of the students/pupils/adults that you are responsible for 
    teaching. Probably it's a bad idea to be a teacher from the age of 21-65 because 
    it's hard to keep learning and teaching at the same time. Perhaps it's best 
    to do the job in short bursts with money making jobs in between!</p>
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  <p>Well, I think Sue hits it on the head and there are signs that PGCEs are 
    moving in the right direction. In the end though it all comes down to money 
    and I suspect we all feel like John Cuthell at times.</p>
  <p>Another source of stress maybe is the lead in time for things like the following.</p>
  <p>Just out- teachers have until July 3rd to apply for a teacher research scholarship 
    for &pound;3,000. very useful if you are doing an MA or a PH.D anyway. You

  <p>The next item derives from the NAACE newsletter, for which thanks</p>
  <p>Niel McLean writes:</p>
  <p>BECTa and QCA have been looking at the issues surrounding ICT teaching at 
    key stage 3. Most readers of this newsletter will be aware that the Secretary 
    of State has identified general concerns over pupils' progress during Key 
    Stage 3. In ICT there are particular issues:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;In only one-third ... of schools at key stage 3 ... do pupils make 
      good progress in information technology.&quot; (HMCI)</li>
    <li>&quot;Teacher assessment results in information technology were full level 
      below other subjects.&quot; (QCA)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The consequences of this poor performance go beyond the immediate, in that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Teachers are prevented from using ICT to teach the higher order thinking 
      skills associated with the upper levels of attainment in other subjects 
      (eg using ICT to support modelling and hypothesis testing in science);</li>
    <li>Few pupils take qualifications in ICT at key stage 4. This puts Government's 
      target that 'by 2002 most school leavers should have a good understanding 
      of ICT, and there should be measures in place for assessing the level of 
      school leavers' competence in ICT' at risk;</li>
    <li>Those developing means of assessing ICT face issues of reliability, validity 
      and standardisation which can only be addressed if assessment items are 
      trialled against a background of consistent teaching;</li>
    <li>ITT providers find it difficult to place ICT trainees in secondary schools 
      with appropriate pedagogy and assessment practices.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Over the past few months BECTa has been working with QCA and DfEE to develop 
    a strategy for key stage 3 that is integrated with the DfEE's wider strategy 
    for literacy, numeracy and science being piloted in 17 LEAs. The aim is to 
    develop and trial a pedagogy for teaching ICT in 5 of those LEAs which will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable pupils to achieve increasingly higher levels of ICT capability;</li>
    <li>Encourage pupils to continue into ICT courses leading to accreditation 
      during key stage 4;</li>
    <li>Raise standards through the application of ICT capability in all national 
      curriculum subjects.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The model being developed includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A curriculum dimension, aimed at developing an exemplar framework for 
      teaching ICT, linked to its use to support teaching and learning in other 
      subjects. The framework will build upon the recently-published schemes of 
      work;</li>
    <li>A support dimension, aimed at developing models of locally-provided school-based 
      support;</li>
    <li>assessment dimension, aimed at developing teachers' formative assessment 
      and providing a test-bed for key stage 3 assessment materials in ICT.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The project is a joint one between DfEE, QCA and BECTa, with BECTa providing 
    the day-to-day management. In later newsletters we'll set out the detail of 
    the project.</p>
  <p>It's important that we find the necessary means of controlled dissemination 
    - we want people to know what's going on, but we don't want schools to rush 
    willy-nilly into copying approaches before they have been properly evaluated. 
    NAACE will have a key role in this. We also need to appoint a project director, 
    so keep an eye open for the advert.</p>
  <p>If you want to know more contact either: niel_mclean
      at becta.org.uk 
    or johnsonc at qca.org.uk</p>
  <p>We can't flesh out all the details at present but will be happy to provide 
    more information. When details are agreed with DfEE/SEU we'll make them available 
    through the newsletter.</p>
  <p>[Note - on a related point. The newly released QCA KS3 ICT schemes of work 
    have been mailed out to schools during the last couple of weeks.]</p>
  <h3>And finally this month....</h3>
  <p>We are planning to start a MirandaNorth led by John Cuthell for &quot;them 
    up there.&quot; We are funding this by claiming some of the Best Practive 
    Research Scholarships to look at Think. This means Oracle and Compaq are also 
    helping out. Get in touch with John if you live in or near Yorkshire as we 
    will be holding some seminars.</p>
