<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>As 2011 draws to a close and 2012 is very nearly upon us, may I first of all wish you all a Happy New Year!</p>
<h4>BETT12 events face-to-face and online</h4>
<p>The MirandaMods at BETT12 are about the value of digital technologies  in raising the achievements of learners, and are being run in  partnership with the <a href="http://www.afa3as.org.uk/">Achievement for All</a> project. We look forward to the participation of members in these  continuing professional development workshops on the future of learning.  Full details of our <a href="../bett/bett12/programme.htm">BETT12 programme</a> including <a href="../bett/bett12/notes.htm">notes for participants</a> are available on the web site. We shall be celebrating the new Fellowships and awarding certificates at 13:30 on Saturday 14<sup>th</sup> January in our networking room in Gallery Room 1 in the Grand Hall before the World eCitizens debate.</p>
<p>We still have room for named speakers and we can provide letters of  invitation by email if required. These eight professional development  events are free. Please let your colleagues know. Anyone who attends  qualifies for a certificate of attendance. You can attend online on  Saturday 14<sup>th</sup> January if you cannot get to Olympia, London.&nbsp;  This is the Twitter hash tag #MMShift2 &ndash; please check the wiki website  for the concept map and Flash meeting registrations: <a href="http://mirandamod.wikispaces.com/">mirandamod.wikispaces.com</a></p>
<h4>The Future of Learning MirandaMods</h4>
<p>Chris Yapp opened the first MirandaMod in the current series at University of Bedfordshire on 30<sup>th</sup> November and was inspirational. One of the teachers who attended the  live workshop said &rdquo;I was amazed by Dr Yapp and his thoughts on the  future of ICT in schools. I really liked the idea of the school being  used out of hours, for the community and totally agree this is a  potential way forward. I also really loved the fact the learning should  be personalised. Pupils would get so much more out of education if it  was streamlined to their needs. I am looking forward to being part of a  community moving forward in which ICT can be used so much more  effectively not only in schools but in the wider community too&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You can see a draft version of the&nbsp; resources we developed at this first session here: <a href="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/researchexchange/events/the-future-of-learning-shift-2/">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/researchexchange/events/the-future-of-learning-shift-2/</a></p>
<p>The next session will be at Bedfordshire on 1st March and 3rd May and  at the Education Show in Birmingham, March 15th &ndash; 17th when members  will have a chance to contribute to Chris&rsquo;s book about the organisation  of learning in the digital era (more about these other sessions after  BETT12).</p>
<h3>New Fellowships</h3>
<p>In this edition of the newsletter we are also introducing ten new  Fellows who have won their awards in 2011. We hope you will be able to  join them receiving their Fellowship certificates on Saturday January 14<sup>th</sup> at 13:30 in  the Grand Hall Gallery Room 1.</p>
<p>The MirandaNet Fellowship have always had a partnerships with company  representatives who have enriched our activities and supported research  and development products. In fact, some of our members have moved from  teaching to companies and back quite often but still remained in the  Fellowship. The first two Associate Fellows are Jennie Martin, Nelson  Thornes and Donna Burton Wilcock, Immersive Education who have  contributed interesting articles about the products they have been  closely involved in developing. In my new role at Bedfordshire, Marilyn  and I are encouraging company representatives as well as educators to  consider undertaking a doctorate based on their experience: Jennie  Martin will be our first student looking at how digital technologies are  forcing publishers to rethink their role in education.&nbsp; If you are  thinking about undertaking a doctorate as an educator, or as a company  representative, do get in touch: christina at mirandanet.ac.uk. The next deadline for applications is the 30<sup>th</sup> January 2012.</p>
<h4>Roger Broadie</h4>
<p>Roger who is a well known debater on MirandaLink submitted an article  about the impact of ICT In education in terms of real costs balanced  against the real learning gains. He argues that the use of ICT in  schools puts significant costs upon the education system in the UK and  other countries. These include the costs of the hardware and software in  schools, training for school leaders and teachers, and in some schools  costs to the individual pupil and their parents. There are also possible  additional costs that introducing ICT might cause, such as distraction  from learning and safety considerations. He believes that it is  necessary to demonstrate that the spend on ICT is at least as effective  in producing learning as the spending of the rest of the school budget.  He would like to establish link, therefore, between the use of the ICT  and learning, and for this to be quantified relative to the spend on the  school buildings and physical environment, on teachers and other staff,  and on resources such as books.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Donna Burton-Wilcock</h4>
<p>My first involvement with digital technologies was the opportunity to  develop an adventure game called Scoop and a newsroom simulation called  Newsnet for the old 8-byte machines we used in schools in the 1980s. So  I really understand the commitment of the authors of educational  software who have usually been teachers in their first life. Donna  Burton-Wilcock is a teacher with a passionate interest in special needs.  In her article she has written about Kar2ouche she explains that her&nbsp;  team wanted to provide all children, whatever their ability, with an  engaging medium for communication. She&nbsp; was one of the team of  educationalists involved in the initial research project who had all  taught children for whom school was a challenge, largely because much of  what they did involved large amounts of text and/or seemed to them  irrelevant. She started with this personal experience. But then looking  into the more widely used definition of special needs as referring to  those pupils who experience some kind of sensory or learning difficulty,  she found that, on average, 20% of pupils in comprehensive schools fell  into this category. Combined with studies showing that computers can  enhance the learning experience of these children, the Immersive  Education team decided that this was an important area to address.</p>

<h4>Stephen Fessey</h4>
<p>In his role at Central Birmingham City Learning Centre and for his  Masters (MEd in E-Learning) Stephen Fessey writes the occasional piece  of research/action research. This is just the kind of valuable sharing  of knowledge that MirandaNet likes to facilitate. Many thanks Stephen  for this interesting piece on a very important subject called: <em>Virtually  Safe: Preparing School Staff for the Implementation of a School-Wide  Online Safety Initiative Through the Effective Use of a School's  Existing Virtual Learning Environment. </em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stephen explains that the initiative set out in this chapter shows  the first stage of a process of developing existing e-learning practices  within a secondary school. The school, working with the author,  designed an e-safety programme with a blended approach to learning which  involves 'the thoughtful integration of classroom face-to-face learning  practices with e-learning experiences.' (Griffin, D., Mitchell, D. and  Thompson, 2009, p8) The online safety programme had two objectives: (1)  To raise awareness of e-safety amongst staff and pupils and (2) to seek  to increase the use of the school&rsquo;s VLE. Staff needed to be trained up  on this new approach and so the initiative discussed in this chapter  focused on the training of staff in the use of a VLE before the  programme&rsquo;s roll out to enable them to deliver an online safety  programme for pupils via the school&rsquo;s Virtual Learning Environment  (VLE).</p>
<p>He is keen for members to read the piece and contact him with any comments.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Glenys Hart</h4>
<p>Dr Glenys Hart has sent us a case study which covers an international  perspective on how digital technologies are deployed in different  countries. Not surprisingly participants were only able to discuss their  own regions of their countries, however, Glenys has come up with a  fascinating overview of development of ICT in learning through a series  of programmes over the space of nearly fifteen years. Starting with the  involvement in Web for Schools Project in Belgium in 1996, and Dublin in  1997, leading Teachers International Professional Developments visits  to schools Poland in 2002 and ECOTEC visit 2009; Norway in 2003; Hungary  (Budapest) in 2006; USA (Connecticut) 2005; China (Beijing) in 2004;  Canada (Montreal) 2007. Plus visits to Italian Schools in 2000, 2001 and  2002 and participation an Arion Educational Decision makers project to  Spain in 2002 on the theme of ICT in the Curriculum with staff from  Belgium, England, Finland, France, Holland, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden  and Poland. A number of visits have also been made to schools in UAE  and Australia. What an amazing range to draw on.</p>
<p>The evidence, of great interest to our international members, is  based on professional dialogues with colleagues who indicate that  information and Communications Technology ( ICT ) is a rapidly changing  subject. Glenys details findings about: ICT professional development;  signs of the reengineering of teaching and learning; appropriate  resource allocation; and technical support. From her conclusion you can  place your country in the continuum of learning she explains.</p>

<h4>Simran Kaur and Marion Scott Baker</h4>
<p>Ms Simran Kaur is one of the principals, of the group of 50 Podar  schools we have been working with in India. Our iCatalyst programme has  been running from 2009 when we met the Podar management team at BETT.  Recently the iCatalyst work on leadership and management that John  Cuthell and I have been supporting has been based discussing the  differences in practice between Indian schools and schools in England in  terms of leadership. In this context Simran Kaur spent a week with  Marion Scott Baker, head of Cheam Pre-Prep. In particular Simran was  assisting in a project about India at Cheam in a week that culminated in  an Indian Wedding. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Simran was particularly interested in Cheam leadership policies about  discouraging negative feedback.&nbsp; In the case study Marion and Simran  discuss how negative feedback is considered to be counter-productive and  inhibiting. The Cheam teachers build up the children&rsquo;s confidence  through encouraging the positive. But they also concentrate on  achievement in the work, not on the level of the child&rsquo;s performance.  Rather than saying &lsquo;good boy&rsquo; teachers say &lsquo;this is good work&rsquo;. They  also discuss why it is good. This is because if a child is told they are  clever then some of the other children give up and others feel there is  no point in trying to do better. The &lsquo;clever&rsquo; child does not feel the  need to strive to do better and will often only do thinks he know he can  do for fear of failure. These approaches are also continued in the way  that the head interacts with her staff.</p>

<h4>Trevor Kerry</h4>
<p>Professor Trevor Kerry has submitted a paper that&nbsp; examines the  nature of a distance-learning Master&rsquo;s level course, based in the UK,  aimed at senior educationists, to students in the UK and around the  world; the paper particularly highlights a group based in Malta. The  current cohort across the university numbers almost 400 students. The  paper deals with the work of a single tutor and chronicles both the  specific situation of a Malta-based sub-group and the opinions of a  wider UK/international group assigned to him. These approaches relate  both to the use of e-learning to achieve effective results at M-level,  and to the underlying philosophies that drive the work. The paper puts  the emphasis on student-centredness in Higher Education (HE) learning.</p>

<h4>Jennie Martin</h4>
<p>Jennie, who is undertaking her doctorate at our new iCatalyst school  at Bedfordshire University, is charged with changing the traditional  approach of publishers to educations needs. Many will remember Jennie at  BT. In her new role at Nelson Thornes she is required me to look at the  ways in which publishers can evolve to develop materials that schools  will find useful in the digital age.</p>
<p>Like many others, the company is beginning to move from books towards  a blended learning approach &ndash; traditional and digital publishing.  Working with the AQA exam board, we have published not only the  supporting books for GCSE and A Level but a range of interactive online  resources as well. These include reinforcement materials and  &lsquo;test-and-assess&rsquo; activities for all of the GCSE and A Level subjects.</p>
<p>Now they are developing publishing learning and assessment resources  online, and in such a dynamic manner, that they can constantly evolve  and respond quickly to curriculum change and learning needs. This  solution is evolving because regular user feedback enables the company  to continually improve not only the learning content, but also the  teacher interface, admin and tools as well.</p>

<h4>Simon Shaw</h4>
<p>Simon referred to his Fellowship case study in the recent MirandaLink  debate about Gove&rsquo;s speech on technology. MirandaNet members can view  the Archive of this discussion by logging in at the Members' section and  looking for the link to the MirandaLink Archive - it's the first item  in the December Thread. If you don't see a link, this means that you  have chosen not to receive MirandaLink, so you will first need to add  yourself to MirandaLink by ticking the box in your MirandaNet profile.</p>
<p>Simon's study is about <em>Exploiting ICT to improve Parental Engagement</em> which focuses on value driven improvement and efficiency. In summary,  the paper explains how investment in new technology is expensive and  "technology led" change does not always lead to more effective practice.  It fact it is often difficult to show measurable gain in performance or  a quantifiable return on the investment. However, once key technology  enablers are in place - such as sufficient levels of school and home  access and familiarity with the internet and devices - then significant  benefit and efficiencies can be gained by schools utilising technology  to improve educational outcomes. The rapid adoption of ICT to improve  communication between parents and schools in England is used as an  illustrative example of a "value proposition". The example shows how the  availability of technology and a campaign to communicate a set of  expectations and educational benefits have led to step changes to both  parental engagement and efficiency measures. More needs to be done to  research and disseminate the "value drivers" - such as parental  engagement - that can lead to better exploitation of technology when  "tipping points" in the availability and use of ICT are reached. Clearly  communicated expectations and exemplar practice can provide a "nudge"  that enables schools to overcome perceived barriers and lead to improved  practice, changed behaviours, greater efficiency and ultimately  enhanced children's learning.</p>

<h4>Chris Yapp</h4>
<p>Dr Chris Yapp has always been generous in contributing to  MirandaNet&rsquo;s wider thinking and was responsible for my new professorial  title: Educational Innovation. It is intended to indicate that digital  technologies are now firmly part of part of mainstream learning.</p>
<p>For his Fellowship award Chris has submitted a piece entitled, <em>What does it mean to be an educated person in 2011?. He begins&hellip;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;In my experience, the more you look at that question, the harder it  gets to answer. Imagine that in front of you there were a group of  people say aged 20. Another group would be aged 30, then 40, 50, 60 and  70 and so on. If I asked you to identify the "best educated" people in  each group, what would you look for and how would it change as you moved  through the groups?&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Donna and Gary Burton-Wilcock: Immersive Education</h4>
<p>I met Donna and Gary Burton-Wilcock out in Argentina where they were  introducing their software to South American teachers. Immersive  Education is well known globally for innovation. They are the developers  of Kar2ouche, MissionMaker, MediaStage and Krucible. They are a couple  with many talents who represent what is best about British software  developers.</p>
<p>Donna taught English for 12 years and has worked as the Senior Editor  and Writer for an open learning company. Whilst studying for a DPhil at  Oxford University, she taught trainee teachers before being co-opted  onto an Intel funded project looking at the impact of computer gaming in  education. She subsequently managed Intel&rsquo;s education programmes in the  Northern European Region which included developing and implementing the  UK version of the Teach to the Future programme. Gary taught Physics  for 7 years before moving into engineering in technology based  companies. Ten years as Technical Director with a small engineering  company, was followed by ten years project managing international teams  working on computer based development for Kraft foods. He now manages  all of the software development for Immersive.</p>
<p>Donna and Gary&rsquo;s initial interest in the potential of technology to  enhance learning began in the late 1980&rsquo;s when they ran an  authority-funded project to raise the attainment of young people  identified as unlikely to achieve any GCSEs within the traditional  secondary school system. The resulting group of students experienced a  range of challenges from the behavioural and motivational to some severe  learning difficulties. Later when given the opportunity to work with  game developers and artists, it was the potential of multimedia and  interactive approaches to engage and provide alternative modes of  communication that lead the thinking. Both Donna and Gary continue to  work with young people in order to inform their understanding of the  problems children encounter with school-based learning, particularly  literacy, and to assess how technology can help enhance the skills they  need to function effectively and participate positively in everyday  life.</p>
<h4>Jane Richardson: Oracle</h4>
<p>MirandaNet has worked with Oracle for many years- particularly on an  early version of social networking for pupils called Think.com.</p>
<p>Nowadays Oracle uses its knowledge in&nbsp; technology leadership to  advance education, protect the environment, and enrich community life.  We seek out intersections between the needs of society and the goals of  our company, and make investments that benefit both. We are proud that  the same innovative spirit behind Oracle&rsquo;s technological success also  drives innovative solutions and programs that benefit communities around  the world.</p>
<p>Oracle works to advance education with state-of-the-art technology programs and to prepare students for life and work in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Oracle has supported K-12 and higher education institutions  with generous in-kind grants of technology, curriculum, and teacher  training resources for more than two decades.</p>
<p>Each year, the Oracle Academy delivers more than US$2 billion in  software, curriculum, hosting services, and teacher professional  development to thousands of education institutions globally.</p>
<p>Oracle donates more than US$11 million in in-kind resources to help  the Oracle Education Foundation implement its award-winning ThinkQuest  program.</p>
<p>Combined, the Oracle Academy and ThinkQuest reach more than 2 million students across 95 countries. Read <a href="../associates/oracle.htm">More</a>&hellip;</p>
<h4>Jennie Martin: NelsonThorne</h4>

NelsonThorne itself sells in  over 130 countries and is one of the UK&rsquo;s leading educational publishers  providing engaging and creative blended learning resources of the  highest quality, supporting teachers and motivating students of all  abilities through all stages of education.</p>
<p>One of Nelson Thornes key online education initiatives is Kerboodle  Secondary - an online learning platform, containing hundreds of engaging  resources to suit the way teachers teach. Kerboodle Secondary is part  of the wider &lsquo;Kerboodle Learning Suite&rsquo; that offers an innovative,  blended range of products to help engage teachers and students using  interactive resources, e-books and apps that all work in tandem with  Nelson Thornes&rsquo; printed books.</p>
<p>Kerboodle Learning Suite is the brainchild of Jennie Martin, Online  Services Director at Nelson Thornes, whose aim is to enable teachers to  use alternative teaching styles to deliver lessons that raise  attainment, whilst engaging learners to help take responsibility of  their own learning.</p>
<p>Jennie has over 25 years experience working in the education sector  and is driven and passionate about teaching and learning opportunities  for all ages and experiences, regardless of geography, personal  circumstances or skills. Jennie believes delivering equality and choice  is a key priority.</p>
<p>She was the ICT Advisor for the Independent Prep Schools Association,  IAPS, whilst also being an advisor on embedding ICT across the school  curriculum. To this day she retains many senior level contacts and  friendships across education &ndash; schools, LA&rsquo;s, Grids, businesses and  agencies &amp; bodies, including the DfE, Besa and Naace.</p>
