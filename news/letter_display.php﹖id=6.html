<p><strong>REMINDER TWO &ndash; MIND MAPPING SEMINAR AT IOE</strong></p>
<p>MirandaNet seminar series</p>
<p>eLearning from a pupils' perspective<br /> Using mind maps as a research instrument</p>
<p>Diane Mavers<br /> Research Fellow, Manchester Metropolitan University</p>
<p>Date: Thursday 29 May 2003<br /> Time: 12:00 - 2:00<br /> Place: Committee Room 1, Institute of Education, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL.</p>
<p>Image-based concept mapping was used as an innovative means of gaining insights into pupils&rsquo; thinking about &lsquo;Computers in My World&rsquo; in the ImpaCT2 evaluation (1999-2002).  ImpaCT2 was a major study commissioned by the DfES/Becta to explore the relationship between networked technologies and educational attainment/learning in the school and out of school environments.</p>
<p>This seminar focuses on the research instruments designed for pupils and what was learned from them. The Pupil Log, Special Report, Internet Questionnaire and peer interviewing provided data on how and why young people use computers, mainly in the home, both for schoolwork and leisure. The seminar also covers the pupils'  views on ICT in society.</p>
<p>This free seminar and sandwich lunch is funded by EU Minerva SchoolScape@future project.</p>
<p>Please email Debra Cook to reserve your place.</p>
<p><strong>A NEW FELLOW</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations, we are very pleased to announce that Dr Daith&iacute; &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Principal, Gaelscoil &Oacute; Doghair, Newcastle West, Co. Limerick, Ireland has achieved Fellowship status.  His case study, <a href="../publications/daithiomurchu.htm">Tom's New Joy in Learning</a>, which was published last month focuses on the use of ICT in Special Needs and a boy called Tom.</p>
<p><strong>NEW SCHOLAR &ndash; DREW BUDDIE</strong></p>
<p>Drew  Buddie met Kaz at BETT03,  and has become a scholar after Kaz described what the Fellowship was all about.   We look forward to learning a little more about Drew  in due course.<br /> drew at royalmasonic.herts.sch.uk</p>
<p><strong>UnITy &ndash; INTERNATIONAL CITIZENSHIP  SITE</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://wec.mirandanet.org.uk/">http://www.domex-unity.net</a></p>
<p>Given the state of international unrest, the MirandaNet Fellowship is increasingly keen to support you in developing International Citizenship projects.</p>
<p>Francis Howlett, John Cuthell, Mara Chrystie and Marion Scott Baker are working on  a new site called UnITy which has private workspaces for pupils as well as a gallery of  some of our projects in this area. Francis will give you a password for the closed areas where there are a lot of interesting exercises for pupils to do.  We&rsquo;d like your opinions.</p>
<p>In the gallery we are including projects in thinking skills, creativity, literacy, numeracy, computer literacy and key skills as well as the obvious links with cultural understanding, concern for world issues and a wide range of subject approaches to the topic of international citizenship.</p>
<p>We have the support of Charles Clarke who was very interested in our international outreach in the recent meeting Tina had with him.  He wanted to know  much more about how we manage international work in general.   Tina hopes she made it clear that it has been the enthusiasm of our membership which has been the mainstay of our international reputation.</p>
<p>If you would like any of your projects featured on our new site let Francis have the link and we can make a connection.  Sometimes it will be a link with your existing case study on the MirandaNet site as many of  these are international in flavour. This invitation extends to all our colleagues abroad and all the MirandaNet chapters. It would be good to round up projects from the past and revisit them as there is so much good practice to share.</p>
<p>The time is ripe for action. Let us have some ideas for what we should do next in international citizenship.  It&rsquo;s time for the conciliators to move into a higher gear. That&rsquo;s us!</p>
<p><strong>A  UnITy WEBSITE GALLERY PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>One of the projects in development about homelessness is reported on by MirandaNet Fellow, Mara Chrystie.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wec.mirandanet.org.uk/gallery.htm">Gallery</a> part of the site is getting very exciting.</p>
<p><strong>HOMELESSNESS  PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>On the UnITy site you will find some work about homeless which is being mounted by young children in East London who identified the homeless as their greatest concern as good citizens.  These 9-10 year olds have shown extraordinary empathy and sensitivity for the plight of people with no homes.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://wec.mirandanet.org.uk/gallery/hermitage.htm">report</a> here.</p>
<p><strong>MULTIMEDIA IN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES &ndash; GEOFFREY SCOTT-BAKER</strong></p>
<p>At <a href="http:/publications/cheam.htm">Cheam School</a> in Berkshire, teachers have been experimenting with multimedia to communicate with fellow students in the USA and China.   They are using the exchange of audio visual resources to bring the project to life.  Extra visual and sound clues are being used to help students understand intuitively what life is like in another country.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Scott-Baker is an independent ICT Advisor and MirandaNet Fellow.</p>
<p><strong>EU SCHOOLSCAPE@Future</strong></p>
<p>We are nearing the end of this project which has been a valuable funding source for  schools involved in international citizenship like the Cheam school above. You will find other reports of international projects in the report below.</p>

<p><strong>EUROPEAN POLICY INITIATIVE</strong></p>
<p>Since January 1997, the European Experts' Network for Educational Technology (EENet) has been working as an informal network of expertise in the field of ICT in Education. The objective of  EENet is the development, implementation and maintenance of a user-friendly online-database and observation system to promote, connect, consolidate, and disseminate knowledge about ICT-related transformations in European school education.   On 7 March 2003, at a Foundation Meeting  held in D&uuml;sseldorf (Germany), EENet became a registered Association.   Irish MirandaNet Scholar Eileen Freeman was elected Vice-Chair of the Board.  EENet has already started to invite new organisational members, details can be found at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eenet.org/">http://www.eenet.org</a></p>
<p>or by contacting Eileen Freeman.</p>

<p><strong>ASTON SWANN</strong></p>
<p>We are delighted to announce a new research project to look at the European Community Driving Licence for Teachers in Basic ICT skills.</p>
<p>INDEPENDENT RESEARCH PROJECT LAUNCHED TO INVESTIGATE TEACHERS&rsquo; ACQUISITION OF ICT SKILLS</p>
<p>3 LEAs to take part in research project initiated by Aston Swann, supported by the British Computer Society and managed independently by MirandaNet.</p>

<p><strong>SUBJECT : WHY WE RECEIVE SPAM  STUDY</strong></p>
<p>Geoffrey Scott-Baker, an ICT Consultant, was sent this URL from a technical newsletter group but felt that it might also be of interest to the Mirandanet community.</p>
