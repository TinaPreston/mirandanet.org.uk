  <h2>February 2000</h2>
  <p>Last Thursday (24th) I visited Oracle in the City and saw Paul Holden and 
    Professor Stephen Heppell preview Scoop 2 aka Think.Com. this is the release 
    we have all been waiting for so anxiously and believe me, it is excellent! 
    Some of the goodies include much improved debating and brainstorming tools 
    and image handling (scaling for example). The improved email tool allows attachments 
    and distribution lists - this means that from April when the new version goes 
    active I may put the Newsletter out through Think. Com. as well as through 
    our usual route.</p>
  <p>The new front end is much less confusing and more powerful. You can create 
    really interesting page layouts and mix text and graphics. You can also provide 
    long lists of URLs. There is now a conversation and hotseat facility, both 
    of which promise to be most useful. There is also now a logout button and 
    a timeout facility so there should be fewer instances of students getting 
    into each others pages. Also in development is a bulk loading tool to make 
    setting up I.Ds and communities simpler.</p>
  <p>All in all it is clear that the Oracle team have listened to the views of 
    the users and have come up with what we asked for. The future looks exciting!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.notschool.net/">Notschool</a> This was also demoed at 
    Oracle and looks most interesting. The DfEE has put serious money into empowering 
    the dispossessed. Basically this project is aimed at school refusers, excluded 
    and long term sick students. I will not go into details of the goodies put 
    in place by the Government but I reckon it's worth getting excluded to get 
    your hands on it (damn - they don't exclude teachers - they sack them). Notschool 
    is on Scoop as well so take a look.</p>
  <p>Another Scoop outfit are New Generations - part of the Learning Circuit - 
    and again, there are wonderful goodies available for any Scoop people who 
    want to get involved. Jane has already flagged this up. It really is good. 
    they provide the opportunity for you to obtain theatre and sports event tickets 
    for free - and all they want is feedback!!</p>
  <p>Tina passed the following items on for me to post.</p>
  <p>Due to the lack of advanced training opportunities currently available to 
    key members of 'Network development and Support' Departments, Salford Software 
    has come to a unique deal with Novell to offer their program of high level, 
    hands on sessions known as ATT's (Advanced Technical Training) to Universities 
    and Colleges, at preferential rates. The training sessions themselves will 
    be held at their UK headquarters in Bracknell and will be delivered by staff 
    from the Development and For news letter Consultancy divisions of Novell.</p>
  <p>There will be two sessions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Session 1 - ZenWorks 2.0 - 2 Days - &pound;650</li>
    <li>Session 2 - NDS - 3 Days - &pound;700</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Further Information on these courses can be found at:</p>
  <p><a href="http://support.novell.com/additional/advtt/emea/conf.htm">support.novell.com/additional/advtt/emea/conf.htm</a></p>
  <p>You can find these courses online at:</p>

  <p>any future queries please do not hesitate to contact me.<br>

  <p>This looks interesting for some of you. Regards, Tina</p>
  <p>Ginn Publishers are looking to develop a Key Stage 2 ICT course based on 
    the new IT orders/ QCA scheme of work. We are looking for people who can write 
    lesson plans, and pupils materials (both print and CD based). The writing 
    will be fee based, and we are looking for people who can write from mid March 
    - July.</p>
  <p>For more information please contact Jill Duffy - jill.duffy@repp.co.uk. Tel 
    01865 314151</p>
  <p>Sometimes the stuff Tina sends in is cryptic to say the least......</p>
  <p>It seemed a roundabout way of getting the information - going to Wollongong 
    - but Barry tells me the Nardoo River simulation can be bought from <a
href="http://www.impty.com.au/">www.impty.com.au</a> - and StageStruck from <a
href="http://www.nida.unsw.edu.au/">www.nida.unsw.edu.au </a></p>
  <p>The Internet: A Writer's Guide at <a href="http://www.internetwriter.co.uk/">www.internetwriter.co.uk</a></p>
  <p>A page of new links for March is now on the website open to all without a 
    password. Every two months (or so) new URLs will be posted up and I'll be 
    sending a brief circular about it. Some of the book's reviews are also onsite.</p>
  <h3>Jane's bit</h3>
  <h4>New on the MirandaNet Site</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Think.com is the new name for Scoop - so now we're thinkers not poop scoopers. 
      The new 'skin' - that's to say the look-and-feel -- is about to appear any 
      day now. Keep looking. It's all been redesigned too, with different functions. 
      So anyone who did not like it enough to run an early adopter trial might 
      like to see if the improvements will change your mind. More at: www.mirandanet.ac.uk/Scoop/think_com.htm</li>
    <li>Fellows on Oracle<br>
      Some of you may be confused - we said we were going to remove people from
        the Oracle Online community who did not appear to wish to be active.
        It
      doesn't now look as if it is technically possible to take names off the
        system So what as happened is that those of you who are not participating
        have been demoted to Readers. This means you can still enter the community
        and browse the system, but you cannot actively participate. If anyone
        changes
      their minds about this, email your 
      (email no longer valid)
      who will reinstate you as a Reporter.</li>
    <li>Diary 2000 - seminars for the year are online and starting soon. Check 
      out the details on:<br>
      1. Online Communities<br>
      2. Developing Software Evaluation Skills<br>
      3. Educating for the 3rd Millennium<br>
      New information and a Registration form online: <a href="diary.php.html">www.mirandanet.org.uk/news/diary.php</a></li>
    <li>February MirandaRose Awards<br>
      The Educational-site-of-the-Month has been awarded to Oneworld - a very 
      thorough portal for all kinds of educational requirements. <a href="http://www.oneworld.net/">www.oneworld.net</a></li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Help-for-Educational-site-of-the-Month MirandaRose Award goes to The 
    24 hour museum - excellent museum site giving the latest museum and gallery 
    news, openings and exhibitions and a wide range of ideas <a href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/">www.24hourmuseum.org.uk</a></p>
  <p>We have been asked what our criteria for judging these awards is and are
     developing our evaluation checklist. If you would like to contribute to
    this, 
    go direct to <a
href="../resources/criteria.htm">www.mirandanet.org.uk/links/criteria.htm</a> and send
     any thoughts to the 
    web editor. </p>
  <h3>Visit Prague : 29th May - 2nd June 2000</h3>
  <p>There was I, planning a quiet Whit week in Prague when.....</p>
  <p>Opportunity for MirandaNet Fellows/Scholars to participate and present at 
    a seminar with Czech Miranda on the 31st May in Prague. The seminar will be 
    based on teachers sharing their classroom activities and experiences. This 
    trip is unfunded so those interested in going to Prague will have to pay for 
    themselves. There are now flights to Prague from Stanstead with GO for &pound;70 
    and Boba Mannova is able to get hotel rooms for participants for approx &pound;20 
    per night. Anyone interested in this trip needs to get in touch with Tina 
    quickly.</p>
  <p>Presentations can be on power-point, on-line or just eye-balling!</p>
