<h2>3. Debate the Role of Digital Technologies in Education</h2>
<h3><strong>IT in Teacher Education (ITTE) UK Annual Conference </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Mon 8 July - Wed 10 July 2013</strong></h3>
<p>In these challenging and changing times and ITTE and MirandaNet members are working together at the ITTE annual conference, expressly to include practitioners in the debates. The ITTE conference will be a great networking event where ICT professionals can discuss current debates that concern us. We will be tweeting highlights as the conference programme unfolds to build up knowledge about ITTE and the conference, see #itteorg</p>
<p>Invited Abstracts - What would you like to give a paper on? The theme of the conference is ‘debates’ examining technology across four strands:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initial Teacher Education - current developments;</li>
<li>Primary ICT: new curriculum and applications of ICT in the classroom;</li>
<li>Secondary: the computer science curriculum, cross curricular applications and ICT application to other subjects;</li>
<li>CPD and whole school issues: digital technologies and professional learning - opportunities and challenges.</li>
</ol>
<p>MirandaNetters are warmly invited to the Radisson Park Inn Hotel Bedford in Bedfordshire UK (45 mins by train, north from London’s St Pancras station; 20 mins north by train from London Luton airport). MirandaNet members are invited to attend the whole three day conference, which runs on from the World Conference for Computers in Education in Poland or, if preferred, MirandaNetters can also attend for just one day: the MirandaMod will be on Tuesday 9th July, followed by a dinner in a boat on the river.</p>

<h2>The ICT curriculum: what next?</h2>
<p>One of the liveliest debates on MirandaLink in February has been about the new draft of the ICT curriculum. MirandaNet will be responding to the second consultation on 16th April with a submission based on the views that members have expressed.</p>
<p>Overall MirandaNet members agree that there is a serious lack of school students across Europe who are enthusiastic enough about the STEM subjects to take them up at university. Rethinking the ICT curriculum and increasing the computer science and computation thinking element meets general approval. However, there is distinct concern about the imbalance created by dropping digital literacy as well as the lack of trained teachers to deliver such a weighting towards computation thinking.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the proposed disapplication of the ICT curriculum by Gove at the BETT12 exhibition the arguments have progressed in MirandaNet about the best way to respond. These have built up into a repository of different perspectives which members will use to plan a submission on the final draft to the Department for Education in England on 16th April.</p>
<p><strong>The Westminster papers</strong></p>
<p>The Westminster Forum on 28th February showed the breadth of our vision as a membership: Christina Preston presented the questions the membership would like to see debated on content, formal professional development and informal learning through communities of practice were presented on MirandaLink that provided the material for an article. Rachel Jones, a MirandaNet Ambassador, gave the industry perspective from her Steljes standpoint. Professor Carsten Trinitis, a Senior Fellow, Professor of Computer Science at Munich and Bedfordshire, looked at the plans from a German perspective. You can also find all the MirandaNet articles that led up to our current views on the subject. <em><a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/researchexchange/articles/ict-curriculum-mirandas-views/">Read more...</a></em></p>
<h2>The ICT consultation 16th April</h2>
<p>Meanwhile MirandaNet will be sending in our submission about the new ICT curriculum on 16th April. Please send in the comments you want included by 9th April to <a href="mailto:christina@mirandanet.ac.uk">christina@mirandanet.ac.uk</a>.</p>
<h2>BETT13 review</h2>
<p>Thanks to the generosity of our annual associates, Iris Connect, Group Call, LightSpeed, Oracle and Steljes, we were able to run a four day debate at BETT13 this year in the new location, Excel, in East London.</p>
<p>Those of you unable to attend MirandaNet's opening session may enjoy Christina Preston's <a href="http://bit.ly/Xo6vfQ">interview</a> with Sir Bob Geldof about his own schooling and his approach to technologies. Sir Bob's appearance was sponsored by Group Call.</p>
<p>We think it is important that those who cannot attend our events can have access to the resources. In this spirit of sharing the videos were filmed by IRIS Connect, the sound equipment was supplied by Light Speed and the projectors and screens by Steljes. We will be putting up the BETT13 videos over the next few weeks. Oracle also helped with our expenses.</p>
<p>Our tabletop associates who offered some interesting demonstrations were: KO-SU, My Knowledge Map, Gebol, Ingot and TSM workshops You can read more about our associates <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/researchexchange/articles/spring-newsletter/associates-news/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Terry Freedman says the show: "The BETT Show is, I’m reliably informed, the biggest education technology show in the world". <em><a href="http://bit.ly/12icIID">Read more...</a></em></p>
<p>Merlin John Online also provides <a href="http://www.agent4change.net/bett-week.html">a round up</a>.</p>
<h2>New Fellows</h2>
<p>The MirandaNet Fellowship was founded thirty years ago. So many colleagues have given their time and energy to making the events still relevant that we have instituted a new award, a <strong>MirandaNet Ambassador</strong>. Many thanks to Dr John Cuthell, Rachel Jones, Theo Kuechel, Dr Katya Toneva and Lawrence Williams.</p>
<p>Members who have recently shared their expertise with the membership at BETT13 are: <strong>Senior Fellows</strong>: David Obst, Dave Smith, Dr Mirka Cernochova and Jim Fanning, <strong>Fellows</strong>: Dan Bowen and Denis Lundie. The abstracts and presentations are <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/researchexchange/events-2/exploring-education-futures/3506-2/">here</a>. Videos will go up soon.</p>
<p>Two Fellows have sent in case studies about tablets in schools: <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/researchexchange/case-studies/an-evaluation-of-ipad-tablet-devices-in-school-across-scotland/">Kevin Burden</a> and <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/researchexchange/case-studies/can-tablets-help-to-remove-barriers-to-reading-for-learners-with-special-educational-needs-and-disabilities/">Abi James</a>. Fellowship articles have also been submitted by Yunusa, A. Abdullahi about <em><a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/researchexchange/articles/developing-and-evaluating-instructional-resources/">Developing and Evaluating Instructional Resources</a></em> and by Atif Hussain, the ICT &amp; Curriculum Specialist at an International school in Cairo Egypt, about <em><a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/researchexchange/articles/the-essential-qualities-for-effective-leadership-in-schools/">The Essential Qualities for Effective Leadership in Schools</a></em>.</p>
<p>The archive of all our case studies is <a href="http://mirandanet.ac.uk/casestudies/">here</a>. Thanks to all our Fellows for swelling the MirandaNet resources.
