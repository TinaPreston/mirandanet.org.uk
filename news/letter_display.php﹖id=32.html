This is possible online. More about this after BETT06.</p><p>  <strong>New Developments in the STAR Project: AS Level English Work<br /> Lawrence Williams, our star globalist, reports </strong> For the last five years, the Holy Cross School in south London has been working with NASA scientists in Cleveland, Ohio, to develop new ways of teaching and learning science. The STAR Project has run very successfully in Year 7 throughout this period, with some outstanding examples of drama, art, narrative, and descriptive work being posted on the <a href="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/STAR/Eye/HolyCross.htm"> NASA STAR web site.</a></p><p> Last term, Autumn 2005, the project was extended into Year 12, where Lawrence Williams is developing AS level English coursework with one of his classes. There are two pieces of work required. One is a narrative piece about a journey to Europa, Saturn&rsquo;s most intriguing moon, where life may well exist. The second is a &ldquo;process&rdquo; piece within which the students record how they have learned to develop their ICT skills, their narrative work, and the inclusion of accurate NASA science data in their stories. </p><p> Actively supporting this work is Joe Kolecki, NASA Mars Pathfinder scientist, Ohio, who is working as an on-line tutor to this London AS Level group. Questions about mathematics, scientific problems and points for general discussion are sent to Joe by email. His detailed and helpful replies are then printed out and discussed, so that each member of the English group can develop scientific accuracy within their narratives, as well a s a broader perspective on their work.</p><p>  We plan to post some of the finished work on the MirandaNet site, later in the year.</p><p>  <strong>dICTatEd - we need another 1,000 primary respondents - can you help?</strong></p><p> Bob Fox is currently doing an analysis of the explanations that &#39;primary folk&#39; (teachers, students, etc) have provided for why ICT should not be an essential component of education - however, we need another 1,000 responses from primary folk to increase the power of this analysis.</p><p> We need your help - if you teach Primary ITE then please tell your students about the dICTatEd questionnaire and get them to fill it in. It takes 9 minutes (approx) to fill in the entire questionnaire - which you can <a href="http://www.meD8.info/qqa/">access here.</a></p><p> If you don&#39;t teach primary folk don&#39;t worry - we would still like you to ask your students to play - we will be moving on to look at secondary folk&#39;s explanations in the not too distant future.</p><p> Filling in the questionnaire should stimulate your students&#39; thinking about why they are using ICT in their own teaching - and can provide the focus for interesting debates within your courses. </p><p>   If you would like to be able to see your students&#39; (annonymised) responses then email me, Peter Twining, with your name, email address, and the name of your institution and I will create a hot link into the questionnaire specifically for your organisation. If your students then use that link to enter the questionnaire I will be able to extract their data and send it to you (in an excel spreadsheet). Check <a href="http://www.meD8.info/dICTatEd/collaborators.htm"> here </a>for a full list of all the folk who are currently collaborating on dICTatEd - you too can be part of this!</p><p>   <strong>New MirandaNet Chapter in Macedonia?<br /> It&rsquo;s Lawrence again!</strong></p><p> Following the very successful day&rsquo;s ICT training visit of a Macedonian educational delegation to Holy Cross School, a new link has been established with the University of Bitola, Macedonia. Lawrence and Susan Williams plan to visit the Education Faculty in Bitola in April 2006, to help support ICT education at the university, and to help them set up a new MirandaNet Chapter. In the meantime, MirandaNet will be offering the Macedonians web space as a way of supporting their movement towards MirandaNet Fellowship.<br /> Lawrence Williams </p><p>  <strong>New Fellows</strong></p><p>  <strong>Dr. Sylvia Rojas-Drummond </strong><br />  See <a href="../international/mexico.htm">her article</a> published in the electronic journal of MirandaNet in the new area for Mexico.</p><p>  <strong>New Scholars</strong></p><p>  <strong>Christina Howell-Richardson </strong><br /> Christina Howell-Richardson is a Research Fellow at the Expert Centre, University of Portsmouth. The centre is a research unit, with a remit to investigate and promote the use of learning technology in higher education, and in the health-related sciences in particular. </p><p> Christina is an Applied Linguist and an Educator, and is especially interested in applying linguistic theories of discourse to understand how technology is used in teaching and learning in higher education. Another interest is the development of pedagogical models for group learning in virtual environments. </p><p> Her current post is a re-entry to full-time work after spending eight years based at home, raising children, writing a PhD and working as a materials developer and part-time lecturer at the Institute of Education. Previous posts include a lectureship in Applied Linguistics at the University of Surrey and a Teaching Fellowship (Applied Linguistics) at Edinburgh University.</p><p>  <strong>Dale Jones </strong><br /> I work for Shropshire Local Authority as a Hands On Support Consultant for Secondary Schools, supporting the embedding of ICT into subject teaching. This involves supporting teachers in whatever area of ICT they wish to address, including the use of digital video to support performance analysis and self review, innovative use of ICT to support creative and factual writing, using online learning environments, use of subject-specific software and ICT tools and the development of learning situations that make appropriate use of the ICT tools available. Prior to this I worked as ICT Co-ordinator in a rural Shropshire secondary school where I developed the online presence and VLE using open source software. The continued development of contemporary technologies to educational uses is where my main interests lie, enhancing and extending learning experiences through ICT and furthering semantic social networks to build sustainable learning communities.</p><p> I am studying for the MSc in Educational Leadership and Management at University College, Worcester. Prior qualifications include an HND in mechanical engineering, a BSc in Secondary Mathematics (QTS) from the University of the West of England and a Postgraduate Certificate in Professional Studies in Education from the Open University. I am married with two children Aneurin and Rhiannon, aged 3 and 2. </p>
