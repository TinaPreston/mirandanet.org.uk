    <h2><a name="cc"></a>Community Capers Unconference (August/September 2008 update)</h2>
    <p>Following the success of our recent MirandaNet Unconference, <a href="../profiles/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=292.html">Bronwyn
        Stuckey</a> a senior Fellow from Australia has set up another kind of
        unconference in Face Book. The technology has suddenly come of age. Do
        get involved with Community Capers below.</p>
    <p>Online Unconference: Community Capers: MirandaNet Case study 1<br>
  Conference Chair: Bronwyn Stuckey, Australia</p>
    <p>If you are on Facebook you can reply to say that you can join us <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=12829414710ref=ts#/event.php?eid=37904617264">by
        following this FaceBook link</a>.</p>
    <p>Join in the activity and knowledge sharing, as a guest blogger, at <a href="http://communitycapers.wordpress.com/">Community
        Capers</a> on the Wordpress blog.</p>
    <p>After the brief introduction to the people, common ties, social interaction
      and place of MirandaNet, we were joined by Chrisitna as community director
      and now invite you as core members to be guest bloggers and later tour
      guides to the community in live events. Let's help welcome members, start
      our knowledge sharing and spread to word to interested colleagues.</p>
    <p>Please note Facebook shows this as a past event - purely because the start
      date has passed (this is a Facebook bug). The activities in this event
      are running for for the next few weeks.</p>
    <h2><a name="un"></a>Report from the MirandaNet Unconference on July 10th 2008</h2>
    <p><strong>MirandaNet Fellows are 'beaming up'</strong><br>
  Digital e-technologies have finally solved the MirandaNet communication problem.
    Communities need to meet face to face from time to time to consolidate our
    collegiality. Some members will never be able to get to meetings in a physical
    location, but email does not quite hit the mark and neither have e-forums
    where members seem reluctant to go.</p>
    <p>The answer has come suddenly through the efforts of MirandaNet Fellows
      and it seems to me to be as amazing as science fiction.</p>
    <p>Do you remember the catch phrase &quot;Beam me up, Scotty!&quot; that
      has made its way into pop culture from the science fiction television series
      Star Trek? It comes from the command Captain Kirk gives his transporter
      chief, Montgomery &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott, when he needs to transport
      back to the ship. Well on the 10th July MirandaNet Fellows were 'beaming'
      in twenty countries (because 'beaming' in English also means a huge grin).</p>
    <p>Thanks to our sponsors, <a href="../associates/lanway.htm">Lanway</a> and <a href="../associates/oracle.htm">Oracle
        Foundation</a>, <a href="../associates/oracle_think.htm">Think.com</a>, we
        debated social networking issues in a workshop with practitioners from
        10:00 am to 4:00 pm (GMT) and then from 6:00 pm to10:00 pm in our Mod
        Unconference.</p>
    <p>MirandaNet Fellows joined us from twenty different countries. They could
      see the video stream of the events on the web - but most importantly they
      could comment and add questions in the side panel. This really enriched
      the meeting we were having on the ground and created a really good atmosphere
      even though we were the only ones with the beer and sandwiches. A longer
      report will be coming out here soon.</p>
    <p>Huge thanks to <a href="../profiles/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=7.html">John Cuthell</a>,

    <h2><a name="fp"></a>Christina Preston receives the Freedom Pass</h2>
    <p>MirandaNetters gathered recently in Croydon to celebrate the occasion
      of Christina Preston receiving her Freedom Pass from the Mayor of London.
      At this august international gathering of lecturers, professors, deans
      of educational faculties and other hangers-on, there was a suggestion that
      academics should deliver their papers to the accompaniment of Music. <a href="../birthday/index.htm">Read
      more about this jolly event and see what happens to braided learning when
      subject to the musical treatment</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="projects"><a name="inspiration"></a>Mapping: What&#8217;s it all about?</h2>
    <p><a href="http://www.inspiration.com/ie/"><img src="../images/inspiration_logo.jpg" alt="Inspiration" title="Inspiration" width="196" height="54"style="float:left; padding: 5px"></a>Members
      of the Miranda Net Fellowship agree that ownership of learning processes
      is an important factor both in raising standards and in making learning
      more constructive and learner-driven. Drawing maps for individual and group
      analysis is important in this approach to learning. In this context the
      members welcome the addition of mind-mapping in <strong>Inspiration version
      8</strong>. In fact, mapping has been such a successful strategy for promoting
      learning in classroom pilots that this professional organisation is exploring
      the same techniques in developing teachers' capacity to evaluate their
      own learning about ICT. The maps are being piloted as a key tool in action
      research projects both in classrooms and as a self-assessment tool for
      teachers. In particular this group has explored non-linear writing and
      multimodal literacy. By talking about the maps in groups teachers begin
      to understand their own concepts about ICT in comparison with the views
      of colleagues. Teachers' ideas about ICT change and expand in these discussion
      face to face and online. They also become more articulate about their ICT
      knowledge and understanding.</p>

    <p>Digital communication is changing the way society communications. Using
      Inspiration is a real opportunity for teachers to experience the impact
      of the transformation in communication tools which is central to the experience
      of their young students.</p>
