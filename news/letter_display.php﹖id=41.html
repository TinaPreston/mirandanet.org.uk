<p><strong>October MirandaNet Newsletter</strong></p>
<strong>Editorial </strong><p>  Surfers have told us that the website is not clear about what the MirandaNet Fellowship is so we have now explained on the front page that the MirandaNet Fellowship, which was founded in 1992, is an e-community of practice for international ICT policy makers, teachers, teacher educators, researchers and commercial developers who are passionate about digital technology in teaching and learning and about using technologies to promote cultural understanding and democratic participation. </p><p>  Currently there are over 850 members in 43 countries worldwide. The website, online forums, seminars, workshops and projects run by members are funded by international partner companies and government agencies. Currently projects are running with 2Simple, Fronter, Inspiration, LogicaCMG, Promethean and Oracle. MirandaNet gratefully acknowledges the support of its sponsors.</p><p>  250 members have become Fellows by contributing articles to the Braided Learning e-journal. We have had an increasing enrolment from Africa, China and countries which are in the Middle East and the Far East.  See a list of all the member countries at the end of the newsletter.</p><p>  You are very welcome.  We would like all members to send us news so that the newsletter better reflects our international membership of educators who are passionate about digital technologies in teaching and learning. </p><p>  <strong>The MirandaNet Mission Statement</strong></p><p>  The MirandaNet Fellowship is a flexible professional organisation which reflects the changes in teaching and learning which have been influenced by digital technologies. For the last fourteen years it has been the custom for members to alter the mission statement to reflect our current views of how we work.</p><p>  This year I have been writing a paper about MirandaNet practice which I will be publishing soon. In the meantime I have made some changes to last years&rsquo; mission statement myself to reflect the evidence of our work. Please send me your suggestions for the 2008 mission so that the statement reflects your views.</p><p>  This is the mission statement so far:<br /> The MirandaNet Fellowship, an international community of practice established in 1992, strives to span national, cultural, commercial and political divides to provide an innovative and inclusive forum for professional educators and to influence worldwide agenda on the use of digital tools in transformational learning. </p><p> Fellows who share their experience and expertise continue to build a professional interactive knowledge base. Individual learning patterns are celebrated through practice-based research strategies, peer e-mentoring and e-facilitation. Self-assessment, peer review, dissemination and publication are central to the Fellowship process. </p><p> Partnership with universities, industry, government and other professional organisations is at the heart of the research, development and evaluation processes that underpin and support evidence-based theory, practice and ethical policy. </p><p> Our tagline is <em>share your experience and expertise.</em> Any new ideas for a tagliine for 2008?</p><p>  Christina Preston</p><p>    <strong>MirandaNet seminars on visual literacy</strong><br /> Saturday 14th October 2006, London</p><p>  Colleagues are warmly welcomed to the MirandaNet workshop series<br /> Fascinating cultural objects: multimodal mapping in teaching and learning<br /> 11:00am to 4:00pm</p><p>   Tasking Visual Learning to the Next Level<br /> Chaired by Michael Smith<br /> Institute of Education, University of London, 20 Bedford Way, WC1H 2AL<br /> (nearest tube- Russell Square.

For more information click on the <a href="../home.php.html">EMPA logo at the bottom of the front page of mirandanet</a> or visit <a href="http://www.bettshow.com/">www.bettshow.com</a></p><p>  Anyone can book an appointment at BETT07 with Christina Preston or John Cuthell online, by visiting <a href="http://www.bettshow.com/">www.bettshow.com</a> and then selecting &lsquo;book an appointment&rsquo; with an exhibitor and choose MirandaNet from the listing.</p><p>   You can use our stand as a place to meet members as well. We will take messages and arrange meetings for you as it is so difficult to make contact with colleagues at BETT07. However, we will not have room for coats and bags this year. </p><p>  <strong>A Major pre-BETT International ICT Conference </strong><br /> Information and Communication Technology: Global Learning Communities<br /> 8 January 2007<br /> Keynote : Christina Preston : World Ecitizens</p><p>  This exciting international conference will explore key issues of global learning communities in relationship to ICT access, the effectiveness of interactive technologies and the creation and educational use of digital media.<br /> <a href="http://www.besa.org.uk/intconf07">www.besa.org.uk/intconf07</a></p><p>    <strong>Peace Room</strong></p><p>   Have you had a look at the <a href="https://wec.mirandanet.org.uk/peace_room"></a>Peace Room?  It really is amazing. </p><p>    <strong>UK-Japan Science Workshop : New Area on MirandaNet</strong></p><p>  Look at the <a href="../international/ukjapan.htm"> new area that has been developed for Lawrence</a> as a result of his involvement in the UK-Japan Science Workshop at Surrey University.  Some nice stuff coming out of it, and a great credit to us to have this published here.  Leads to a further six pages so far.</p><p>  <strong>Video Games: School Practicalities</strong><br /> Mechelle De Craene </p><p>  Just wanted to send you another brief article I wrote regarding video games. I thought it may be helpful for teachers who may want to try video games.</p><p>   <a href="http://terry-freedman.org.uk/artman/publish/printer_853.php">http://terry-freedman.org.uk/artman/publish/printer_853.php</a></p><p>  <strong>Teachers Resources for KS1 and KS2</strong><br /> Francis Howlett</p><p>   Whilst tidying up my Inbox I came across a note from Charles Murray about eWorkshop, a rather nice Canadian site with teaching materials suitable for KS1&amp;2 level, and much else besides.</p><p>   &lsquo;Our site is extensive, covering literacy and numeracy teaching in Grades 1-6. It is an excellent resource for teachers and is used in school boards and faculty programs throughout the province of Ontario here in Canada. A variety of video and audio clips demonstrate teaching points described using real teachers and students. In addition, we are developing the site into a portal for other initiatives such as allergy response.&rsquo;<br /> <a href="http://www.eworkshop.on.ca/">http://www.eworkshop.on.ca</a></p><p>   <strong>Recommended conferences </strong></p><p>  <strong>Mathematical Association of New South Wales</strong></p><p>  Douglas Butler, a Mirandanet Fellow, was privileged to be invited to give the opening keynote to the 2006 MANSW Conference (Mathematical Association of New South Wales) in Sydney on 8th September.</p><p>   New South Wales has had a very conservative view of its curriculum, and is in the process of redesigning its secondary mathematics syllabuses for the first time in 25 years.  This contrasts with all the other Australian States which have been on a steady revision cycle every 5 years or so.  </p><p>   Douglas used this opportunity to look at some of the ways technology can enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics.  He showed some topics, such as vectors in 2D and 3D, and probability and statistics, none of which appear in their courses at the moment, and which technology can bring to life spectacularly.</p><p>   His presentation included an innovative use of Google Earth and a new on-screen protractor. With these tools he explored the angles of famous buildings, eg the Pentagon in Washington, and the link between the direction of prevailing winds and the siting of airport runways.</p><p>   The <a href="http://www.tsm-resources.com/mansw"> PowerPoint and other related files</a> can be downloaded.</p><p>  <strong>2nd International Conference Art in Early Childhood</strong></p><p>  our people, our place, our time<br /> 2nd International Conference Art in Early Childhood<br /> University of New England, N.S.W.

Early childhood educators, primary teachers, tertiary teachers, researchers, parents, artists, students, administrators, are all invited to take part in the 2nd International Art in Early Childhood Conference.</p><p>  <strong>Conference Features</strong><br /> Presentations by well-known researchers in art and early years <br /> A special socio/cultural/ historical focus <br /> A focus on drawing <br /> Presenting recent initiatives of galleries in Australia <br /> Exhibition demonstrating how young children engage with art in the wider                 community <br /> Opportunities for conversations that challenge assumptions about art and young children <br /> Recent initiatives in arts based research and visual methods<br /> A special focus on the narrative and experience of art for young children <br /> A special focus on the concepts of creativity as they relate to young children&#39;s art experiences.</p><p>  Margaret Brooks </p><p>    <strong>New Scholars   Qasim Akinreti </strong><br />   Qasim Akinreti is an Online Journalist with Voice of Nigeria and Chairman Education Committee, Lagos Council, Nigeria Union of Journalists. He has a Master&#39;s Degree in Online Journalism from the Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK in 2003. </p><p>  On his return, he has been involved in advocacy programmes for capacity building in ICT and Online Journalists for students of Mass Communication, Journalism Institute, Polytechnics and Journalist ICT Center in Lagos.

We undertake activity on a local, national and international basis and have established a network of colleagues and contacts across the globe. We focus on the application of new and emerging technologies within the workplace. This typically involves schools and colleges although we are also working with people in the commercial and public sectors. </p><p>  I am the programme director for a number of higher education programmes including a Foundation Degree in Applied Digital Media (Learning) and a Masters degree in Leadership and Learning. I also teach modules on social software and Web 2.0 technologies on our MEd in e-learning programme. </p><p>  My research and evaluation work is centred around the concept of digital literacies and the role of technology in the development of these new literacies. I am currently working with a number of colleagues in the UK and in Australia to explore this area and would welcome wider involvement. I am particularly interested in visual literacies and have worked with a wide variety of students to develop a broader understanding of how media and video can be used to deepen our understandings and ideas. </p><p>  <strong>Martin Dixon</strong><br />   I work at Chelsea Children&rsquo;s Hospital School as ICT Manager.  This year I have been very busy connecting our 4 hospital sites together on a single domain. We are nearly there! This is one of the many ways we work using ICT to improve the quality of education received by children during their stay in Hospital.  We also have a project to bring wireless internet access and video conferencing to children who spend their time in hospital in isolation.</p><p>  <strong>Richard Hawkins </strong><br />   ICT and Education? I think at first it was about using ICT to teach and learn old things in new ways. Now I&#39;m much more interested in using ICT to teach and learn new things in new ways.</p><p>  <strong>Damian Maher</strong><br />   I have been a primary school teacher for about 16 years. I have seen computers grow in complexity and number in schools in that time. I am keen to understand how to use computers in the classroom to assist students learn. I am particularly interested in the Internet as a communication tool. I think this aspect of computer use is very limited in schools and that the research is also limited. I have just completed a Doctorate on the Internet as a communication tool in the upper primary school classroom. I am continuing to provide access for my students online and am interested in discussing relevant issues with other interested people.</p><p>  <strong>Chris Merrick </strong><br />   Having worked at all levels in Early Childhood Education from class teacher to LEA advisory level I left the UK to join Zurich International School just over four years ago. As Assistant Principal with responsibility for Early Childhood, I worked with an enthusiastic group of teachers and a very supportive IT department to integrate the use of IT throughout the Early Childhood grades. We developed our use of digital technology to produce documentation on children&#39;s learning for their portfolios, displays and booklets, the use of still and video material and the incorporation of IT based projects with the 3, 4 and 5 year olds. Working and learning together with the children, projects have included animated stories with pictures and narration by the children, creative photographic work and the use of digital photography to enhance other creative work, many pieces relating to their literacy work and using digital photography to aid children&#39;s participation in decision making processes. We have also developed a great commitment to the use of digital technology as a means of reviewing our own practice and professional development. The need to return home to the UK has meant that I have reduced my involvement with them to 50% but I remain interested in finding different ways of tapping into very young children&#39;s naturally multimodal ways of learning and expressing themselves and using digital technology as a medium for them to do this. </p><p>  <strong>Please send any items you would like in the newsletter for members to  Editor : Anne Dobson </strong></p><p>  <strong>A list of all the member countries</strong><br />  Of a current active membership of 433, we can identify members from the following countries.
