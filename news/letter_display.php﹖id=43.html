Recently on a study leave doing a PhD in ICT in Education at the London Southbank University. I work and live in Thessaloniki, Greece. </p><p>  I have completed an MA at the Institute of Education in ICT in education. My first degree comes from Greece. A BA in Primary Education from the University of Athens. </p><p>  In addition I have participated as a consultant (pedagogic evaluation and creation of on line tests and courses for e learning) in the <a href="http://www.estudy.tc.pl/"></a>Leonardo European project by the name e-study.</p><p>    It was one of the 32 success stories out of 168 participation in the Leonardo European Projects.</p><p>  <strong>Yvonne Buchanan-Coutts</strong></p><p>  I am currently a 4th year BEd Primary student at Moray House School of Education in Edinburgh.  I am a mature student with 3 children (1 at primary level and 2 at secondary school).</p><p>  As a parent, I am intrigued to see how much ICT is used by students and how far it has progressed in the classroom even in the last few years. </p><p>  However, as a student teacher I am interested in the way ICT, and in particular interactive whiteboards, can motivate learners and whether or not they are as effective in a learning situation as the research (mainly carried out by whiteboard providers) actually states.  This curiosity is what has instigated my own small scale research study to be carried out during the early months of next year (2007) as part of a final year professional project. </p><p>  As a member of MirandaNet, I believe I will be able to use current published findings to inform and support my own findings, possibly providing another view to the investigations or supporting those already found. </p><p>  <strong>Claire Campbell </strong></p><p>  I am interested in looking at how e-Learning and the use of ICT in education can provide enhanced user experiences and can facilitate widening participation and increased access.  I am particularly interested in lifelong learning and how e portfolios can contribute to this especially in the sphere of family life when parents often take extended breaks from careers for family reasons.</p><p>  <strong>Ryan O&#39;Donnell</strong></p><p>   Hi there. I&#39;m a new teacher (as of 6 months ago) and have been given the exciting job of teaching ICT and computing at the school, and also co-ordinating where the school goes technologically ... and then keeping everything running (everything from ordering printer ink to installing new servers). The staff have many ideas about using technology in the classroom and are keen to embrace it, and it&#39;s my job to implement those ideas.</p><p>  <strong>Christine Wilkinson </strong></p><p>   I have been the ICT co-ordinator at a small rural primary school for the last 6 years. I believe that ICT has been one of the main contributors to improved pupil and staff learning. I am excited by the ongoing improvement in our ICT provision. We have only recently invested in interactive whiteboards and BT has just managed to bring broadband to our remote location. Eighteen months ago I began studying for a National Professional Qualification for Headship and have been bitten by the studying bug. In September I began an MSc in Leadership and Learning and whilst searching for papers relating to personalised learning came upon MirandaNet. Many years ago I taught in a Harambee school for girls in Kenya and have been actively seeking ways to re-establish a relationship with education in the area. A brief appraisal of the MirandaNet website has convinced me that as an organisation I would be able to learn a great deal from your collective expertise that would benefit my school working practice, my personal studies and my desire for closer global links. </p><p>  <strong>New Members</strong></p><p>  <strong>Alice McDonnell </strong><br /> I teach mathematics and ICT.</p><p>  <strong>Midori Ozawa </strong><br />  I&#39;m interested in utilizing ICT for teacher professional development, more specifically the potential and the roles of online learning community.  </p>
