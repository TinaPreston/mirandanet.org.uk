<h3>New Fellows</h3>
<p>We are delighted to announce the award of two new new Fellowships      to Joyce Gikandi and John Clayton in New Zealand. Both papers have a  strong     evidence-based slant but are nevertheless eminently readable.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s study, based on the situation in New Zealand take the view  that   teachers should be identifying the learning agenda for  themselves. He highlights   two distinctly different professional  development models that are current in   New Zealand, deficit and  empowerment. url I was particularly struck by a quotation that  illustrates the deficit model that is too well-known around the world:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&ldquo;Initial professional development is  provided, where external experts   delivered preconceived learning  events to specifically address their understanding   of the identified  deficiencies in teachers knowledge, did not fully acknowledge   teachers  held views of teaching and learning and ICT that would be resilient    and resistant to change"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(Gilbert, J. 1993. Teacher development: A  literature review. In B. Bell (Ed.),   I know about LISP but how do I  put it into practice? (pp. 15-39). Hamilton:   CSMER University of  Waikato).</p>
<p>John is researching professional development (PD) into digital   technologies   in teaching and learning which is central to the   Interests of many MirandaNet   members, particularly researchers like   John Cuthell, Niki Davis, Norbert Pachler,   Marilyn Leask, Sarah Younie   and myself. The MirandaNet iCatalyst model   (www.mirandanet.ac.uk/profdev)   of professional development that has   been built on much of that research has   been specifically designed to   put teachers in the driving seat rather than   being treated as   passengers in learning. You will find some of the relevant     publications by MirandaNet members about Professional Development in   digital   technologies in the Publications section at the end of this   Newsletter.</p>
<p><strong>John Clayton: The provision of professional development in ICT: Exploring deficit and empowerment   models</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br /> Over the last decade there have been significant increases in the  integration   of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) in New  Zealand educational   institutions. Investment in infrastructure,  hardware and applications has been   supported by a corresponding  increase in the funding for Professional Development   (PD) provision  for staff in ICT. This is based on the assumption that the level   of  competence and confidence of staff in ICT impacts directly upon the  capacity   and capability of institutions to positively engage their  learners in ICT-supported   learning environments. Building on the  experiences of investigations into the   compulsory sectors "ICT PD  cluster model" this paper highlights two   distinct models, deficit and  empowerment, currently used in the provision of professional development  to staff.</p>

<p><strong>Joyce Gikandi: Engaging with formative assessment for meaningful online learning</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br /> With ubiquitous of digital technological advancements, educational  researcher   and practitioners continue to seek ways of how to use the  technologies effectively   in promoting educational experiences at all  levels of education.From formal   educational perspectives, it is now  evident that these technologies especially   the web-based technologies  need to be integrated in pedagogically sound ways   to benefit teaching  and learning transactions (Garrison &amp; Akyol, 2009).   This is  critical in web-based distance learning (online learning) particularly    within higher education contexts. There is common consensus that online  learning   has provided flexible opportunities to learners who cannot  fit face-to-face   (f2f) educational contexts due to personal and  situational circumstances particularly   related to work and family  commitments. Online learning provides educational   opportunities  irrespective of temporal and spatial gaps between the teacher   and the  learner. However, in a recent review of related literature, Garrison    and Akyol (2009) indicate that online learning (as compared to f2f  contexts)   has distinct pedagogical demands that could descend into  constraints if not   adequately addressed. Learner and assessment  centred environment can provide   a way to create effective online  learning designs. Integrating formative assessment in online learning  environments can facilitate such a pedagogical design.</p>

<h3>New Scholars in September 2010</h3>
<p>Professor Roberta Weber, a long term academic colleague, expresses  our mission   statement in a different but effective way. In her twenty  year experience she   has come to see digital technologies    as the  means by which learners can connect together the knowledge and skills    necessary in the 21st Century with the foundation of thinking  critically.</p>
<p>Two Greek educators have joined, Kleopatra Nikolopoulou and Efstratia  Liakopoulou.   We hope more Greeks will join in order to participate in  the new phase of our   Etopia project. Leon Cych, Theo Kuechel and I  meet them at a conference in   Korinthos where we ran the last  MirandaMod. More about Korinthos and Etopia   in the newsletter. We hope  that Olga Zavjalova, a teacher in Estonia, will   also join our  project.</p>
<p>Sharmaine Sharusan, a doctoral student, calls herself a  techno-optimist. &ldquo;I   believe in the promise of technology to make our  lives easier and freer&rdquo;.   This is very near our mission statement as it  stands. Helen Smith comes to   us via the route that many take: "I have  been in Computing / ICT Education   since 1990, first as a teacher and  latterly as a teacher trainer", while   Jamie Buckley (joined last  month) is a journalist who is doing an MA in engaging   children in  animal welfare using a learning platform. He does not fit the  traditional   profile of an educator any more than Peter Klein does.  Peter has a varied background   in ICT as so many of us now have: a  blend of commercial know-how, university   lecturing and charitable  objectives. He represents the multi-faceted education   consultant with  many strings to his/her bow.</p>
<p>Rohit Chaturvedi wants to network with members to improve his ICT  knowledge.   David Mottram is doing some outstanding work for 3- 19 year  old students with   severe and complex physical/ learning disabilities.  His purpose in joining   MirandaNet is to network and share best  practice to improve our work. He says   he would welcome MirandaNet  contacts to help the school achieve the very best   for our young  people.</p>
<p>This reminds me to encourage members get in touch directly with any  new scholars   who have common interests to you. Emails are added in the  Newsletter so that   you can welcome them, but emails are removed from  the web site version of the   Newsletter to protect you from spam  harvesters. If there are groups of members   with specialist interests  there are a number of ways in which we can use the   site for  collaborative work: please get in touch with me.</p>
<p>Christina Preston</p>
<p><strong>Rohit Chaturvedi</strong></p>
<p>I am working profession who have a sound knowledge in ICT in  Education field.   I would like to achieve goal of my life that's why I  am here to join it.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Klein</strong></p>
<p>Peter has lived and worked in Asia,   Europe and the USA for a  variety of technology companies. Having run several   companies he is  focused on applying new media, networking and collaboration   solutions  to improve sales and service at organizations focused on sustainable    growth. Peter applies real experience, in sales, marketing, operations  and   accounting with collaboration,social media, networking and  branding.</p>
<p>Peter speaks at conferences around the world on Social Media,  Branding and   the subject of using social media to impact  sustainability. Peter is also a   Lecturer at Brunel University and runs  <a href="http://educateethiopia.com/">Educate   Ethiopia</a>,   a charity that helps keep 21 schools open in Ethiopia, allowing 6000 children   to stay in school.</p>
<p><strong>Efstratia Liakopoulou</strong></p>
<p>I work as an ICT teacher in Experimental High School of Tripolis,  Greece.   I am interested in ICT teaching, project work, web 2.0,  e-learning, getting   familiar with new ICT tools and educational  practices, motivating students,   creative teaching,  collaboration/communication with European teachers, participating   in  European projects etc. I am also interested in gender issues, equal  opportunities,   educational policy &amp; school management.</p>
<p><strong>David Mottram</strong></p>
<p>I'm ICT Subject Leader at a Specialist (Sensory and Physical) College  for   3- 19 year old students with severe and complex physical/  learning disabilities.   Our work is outstanding (Ofsted 2009) with a  strong emphasis on access and   inclusion to improve outcomes for all  our learners. This is driven by a commitment   to AAC technologies and  digital inclusion strategies, areas which myself and   our strong SALT  and expert partner teams always wish to expand and explore.   We seek to  network and share best practice to improve our work, and would welcome    contacts to help us achieve the very best for our young people.</p>
<p><strong>Kleopatra Nikolopoulou</strong></p>
<p>Research interests: uses of ICT in education and their effects in  teaching   and learning, integration and use of ICT in early childhood  education, teacher   training in ICT and teachers' attitudes, gender and  ICT in education</p>
<p><strong>Sharmaine Sharusan</strong></p>
<p>I am a techno-optimist; I believe in the promise of technology to  make our   lives easier and freer. I am working on my doctorate in  Educational Technology   and am always interested in the ways we can  reach global learner especially   in light of the looming teacher  shortage.</p>
<p>In life we are always learning, we learn from each other as part of  the transmission   of knowledge. With the emerging technologies and  measurable advances in computing   power, as educators we are poised  once again to be on the cusp of the society   cultural revolution (akin  to when the book became the killer-app.). We live   in the information  age with more creation and organizing of data, shuffled,   sorted,  refined and then synthesized by learners of all types. We can either    let entropy happen and allow chaos to emerge or we can tap into the  resource   and guide the direction of the processes governing  acquisition and possession   of knowledge. In the end, education  involves the exploration and application   of information; if we do  nothing with our resources but merely collect them   then we have not  advanced.</p>
<p>I believe in the promise of technology to enable us to do more, to  allow us   to be more than able. As teachers we can share our enthusiasm  for lifelong   learning and encourage our students to go further than  we have, to press forward   into the unknown future armed with skills to  adapt and create a promising future.</p>
<p><strong>Helen Smith</strong></p>
<p>I have been in Computing / ICT Education since 1990, first as a  teacher and   latterly as a teacher trainer. I am currently involved in  education on the   subject programmes (ICT Education) and also involved  in the Masters Programmes   (Education). My special areas of interest  are:</p>
<ul>
<li>motivation and mindsets</li>
<li>in depth subject knowledge as a prerequisite in motivating and facilitating       learning</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Roberta Weber</strong></p>
<p>I have been teaching in higher education for 20 years and believe  that integrating   technology into instruction provides one of the best  models for helping learners   connect the knowledge and skills necessary  in the 21st Century with the foundation   of thinking critically.</p>
<p><strong>Olga Zavjalova</strong></p>
<p>I am going to write my masters paper about teaching integrated skills  to primary   level students using whiteboard activities. Looking very  actively for a new   materials,but the topic is quite new and not enough  material for my topic.</p>
