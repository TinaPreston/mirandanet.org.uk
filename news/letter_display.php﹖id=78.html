David has written an absorbing journal of a <a href="../publications/digital_day.htm">digital day in the life of an Essex school</a>, and David has developed the <a href="http://www.elmo-visualiser.co.uk/visualiser-lesson-ideas-online-magazine.asp">Visualiser Magazine</a> (published on the Elmo site) as a result of the Visualiser Forum meetings.</p> <h3>Mobile Learning or Handheld Learning: What do we mean?</h3> <p>Warm thanks to all the contributors to the <strong>December MirandaMod</strong>: Norbert Pachler, John Traxler, Graham Brown Martin, and especially Elisabeth Hartnell Young who was backpacking in New Zealand but still managed to log in.</p> <p>Not only was the WLE Centre room full, but there were also more than 20 participants coming in on Flash meeting. You can find a brief report with links to the video, the map and other resources on the <a href="../mirandamods/dec09_mod.htm">MirandaMod</a> section of the MirandaNet Web Site.</p> <h3>Win a new Apple iPod Video Nano (8GB)</h3> <p>Take part in an <a href="http://www.survey.hull.ac.uk/videosurvey">on-line survey</a> for <strong>EdutubePlus</strong> and you might win an iPod!</p> <p><strong>EdutubePlus</strong>, is a European project to design a bespoke curriculum related video clips library for educators (<a href="http://www.edutubeplus.info/">www.edutubeplus.info</a>). As part of this we are hoping you may be able to help us in researching how educators (e.g. teachers, lecturers) select and use digital video clips in their teaching.</p> <p>Educators around the world are using video resources more often to support and enhance their teaching, but little is known or understood about how they search and select video resources. This survey is designed to explore how educators search and select video resources and how they subsequently use them to support learning.</p> <p>We are looking for contributions from all sectors and phases of education who use video clips in their teaching. The results will be published and will help to inform policy and practice in this area. Thank you, in advance, for taking the time to complete the survey. It should take you no more than 15 minutes.</p> <p>The survey is available at: <a href="http://www.survey.hull.ac.uk/videosurvey">www.survey.hull.ac.uk/videosurvey</a></p> <p>In recognition of your contribution to this research we are offering a new Apple iPod Video Nano (8GB) as a prize.</p> <p>Many thanks</p> <p>Kevin Burden (The University of Hull)<br /> Theo Kuechel (research consultant for The University of Hull)</p> <h3>Learning in the Age of Web 2.0</h3> <p>Leverhulme Lecture Series on the theme of Learning Networks</p> <p>Professor <strong>Caroline Haythornthwaite</strong>, who spoke at our last MirandaMod on <a href="../mirandamods/dec09_mod.htm">mobile Learning</a>, is the new Leverhulme Trust Visiting Professor, 2009-10, Institute of Education, University of London and who is presenting a series of lectures at the London Knowledge Lab next term.</p> <p>The increased availability and use of the Internet for resource discovery and learning is changing teacher and learner expectations about where, when and from whom they will learn. The ubiquitous connection &ndash; on laptops, mobile phones, and PDAs &ndash; brings information nearly anywhere, anytime. It also brings with it questions about how to use the Internet to promote and sustain learning, how to balance benefits of face-to-face communication such as immediacy, authenticity and attention, with the reach of online communication and its potential to engage learners through the use of new, dynamic platforms from online chat to games and online worlds. Questions also arise around the social dynamics of these new learning configurations: what roles are now appropriate for teachers and learners? And, what theoretical perspectives best characterize the new dynamic and new responsibilities associated with Web 2.0 information production?</p> <ol>     <li>Feb. 04, 2010: Learning and scholarly communication in the age of the Internet</li>     <li>Feb. 23, 2010: New theories and perspectives on learning in the digital age</li>     <li>Mar. 11, 2010: Social networks and learning</li>     <li>Mar. 30, 2010: Social informatics: E-learning as a socio-technical intervention</li> </ol> <p>Further details for these next four seminars can be found on the Institute Web Site (<a href="http://www.ioe.ac.uk/">www.ioe.ac.uk</a>)</p> <p>Caroline edited a First Monday paper about online learning models that includes a section on Braided Learning by Christina Preston that investigates MirandaNet online practices:</p> <p>Haythornthwaite, C.
