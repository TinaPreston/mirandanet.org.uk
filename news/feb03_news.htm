    <p>2. ICT RESEARCH</p>
    <p>You may be interested in a number of new reports Becta have published at 
      the BETT show, now available on the Becta Research website: <a href="http://www.becta.org.uk/research/">www.becta.org.uk/research</a></p>
    <p>* ImpaCT2 - Pupils' and Teachers' Perceptions of ICT in the Home, School 
      and Community</p>
    <p>The third ImpaCT2 report demonstrates that pupils have an extensive awareness 
      of the role of computers in today's world, and they can develop skills in 
      using ICT more quickly and easily than is often anticipated by schools and 
      teachers. It recommends that more time should be spent on exploratory learning 
      in curriculum subjects and less time on teaching skills in discrete ICT 
      lessons. Taken together, this major study shows that even though there is 
      some way to go before the transforming potential of ICT in teaching and 
      learning is fully exploited, the positive impacts are already coming through 
      for both pupils and teachers.</p>

    <p>3. DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT</p>
    <p>Marjorie Scardino, Pearson's Chief Executive is well respected in the publishing 
      industry, her views carry weight. Mike Smith of NAACE commented that was 
      interesting, therefore, to read two accounts of her BETT03 speech that vary 
      so widely as to make one think that must have been two people with the same 
      name appearing at the Show. The usually reliable e-Government Bulletin, 
      an email newsletter, says, &quot;In the background, a debate is raging about 
      how much valuable traditional schooling techniques are in danger of being 
      lost in the rush to introduce new technologies to the classroom&quot; Then 
      comes the surprise: &quot;However later in the conference Marjorie Scardino, 
      chief executive of publishing giant Pearson, articulated possible concerns 
      about greater use of technology. 'A worry is that more computers in education 
      could be a distraction, absorbing the attention of our children so completely 
      that they fail to learn things that you can only get from novels like Jane 
      Austen's,' she said.&quot; The article continues: &quot;Scardino also expressed 
      concern that teachers could be brushed aside in the rush to e-learning. 
      'I'm a bit worried that the teacher is being forgotten in all this. You 
      can't just sit a child in front of a computer and expect it to work,' she 
      said.&quot;</p>
    <p>The Becta <a href="http://www.becta.org.uk/extra/detail.cfm?extra_id=960">press 
      release</a> of the Jane Austen bit reads differently: &quot;Marjorie acknowledged 
      that there has been a tendency to see technology as getting in the way of 
      learning; to feel that somehow television and computers will destroy children's 
      ability to understand and appreciate Jane Austen. However, she continued, 
      children are finding their own ways of learning with technology and making 
      school exciting. &quot;It's now time to start loving it, to start appreciating 
      it,&quot; she said, but warned, &quot;The goal has got to drive the change.&quot; 
      And the concluding paragraph: &quot;Marjorie Scardino finished up by saying 
      that ICT in education works if, at heart, it is about learning and if we 
      are prepared to adapt and work together. &quot;We do know that, properly 
      used, ICT in the classroom does produce results[but] we've taken a small 
      step in a long revolution,&quot; she concluded.'</p>
    <p>Are people being influenced by the anti-ICT statements that appeared following 
      the publication of ImpaCT2? Says Mike Smith, It was this reporting, no doubt, 
      that led the Secretary of State to introduce his BETT speech with the following 
      strong statement: &quot;I want to use this opportunity here to assert very 
      strongly my belief and the Government's policy, that information and communications 
      technology (ICT) makes a massive addition in value to the teaching and learning 
      of students and young people in our society. There have been people who 
      have contested whether that's true, and I want to take this first major 
      platform since I was appointed as Secretary of State to challenge the proposition 
      that ICT doesn't offer value, and to assert the belief that it does. I also 
      want to commit the Government to policies to make ICT's value to education 
      even better and even stronger. That's what I want to say today.&quot;</p>
    <p>So what do MirandaNettters think?</p>
    <p>4. IMPLEMENTING ICT</p>
    <p>Mike Bostock, a MirandaNet consultant, would like comments on Implementing 
      ICT which is the web-based revision of the successful paper publication 
      by the same name. It went live last Autumn and can be viewed at <a href="http://www.thelearnzone.net/">www.thelearnzone.net</a>.</p>
    <p>5. ICT: A STUMBLING BLOCK OR A STEPPING-STONE?</p>
    <p>A report from one of our new Scholars Georgina Stein:</p>
    <p> The Kent IT in Schools (KITSch) NOF Programme of Study has engaged with 
      22,070 registered teachers, and teaching assistants over the past three 
      years and a half years. Every element of the provision offered by each NOF 
      Approved Training Providers (ATPs) has been carefully scrutinised throughout 
      this time and reported on by the Teacher Training Agency (TTA)</p>
    <p>The Quality Assurance report by the TTA indicated,</p>
    <p>'The [KITSch] training materials, both on-line and in hard copy, are strengths 
      of the programme. The materials and web site have continued to be developed 
      and KITSch's knowledge and experience have been used by several other training 
      providers. The trainers are experienced, well trained, well supported and 
      effective. The management and administration of the programme, in particular 
      the internal quality assurance, are also strengths.</p>
    <p>The strategies adopted to inform the continued development of Information 
      and Communication Technology (ICT) in teacher education should not be left 
      to chance.</p>
    <p>The KITSch 'Together we will make a difference' case study seeks to identify 
      the key KITSch success factors.</p>
    <p>Initial Teacher Educators and Continual Professional Development providers 
      wishing to build 'stepping-stones' for ICT in Education may find this study 
      of interest.</p>
    <p>All of the KITSch resource materials and online support are now freely 
      available to teachers, teaching assistants and students throughout the UK 
      and beyond.</p>
    <p>To find out more go to: <a href="http://www.cant.ac.uk/kitsch/">www.cant.ac.uk/kitsch</a> 
      or <a href="http://smarteducation.org.uk/">http://smarteducation.org.uk</a>

    <p>6. GTC SUMMARY</p>
    <p>'Building a Community of Practice' is a three-year project run by MirandaNet 
      Ltd on behalf of the General Teaching Council.</p>
    <p>The aim of the project is to provide an e-mentoring programme, leading 
      to accreditation, for the e-facilitators who will engage with the GTC website's 
      online community of teachers. Efacilitators will take on different GTC roles 
      after their first qualification such as ementors, ejournal reviewers, programme 
      planners and trainers. New modules will be designed, if funding allows, 
      building up to a diploma or an MA.</p>
    <p>7. LITERARY REVIEW</p>

      commissioned by NestaFuturelab which are now available on the web.</p>
