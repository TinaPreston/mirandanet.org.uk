MirandaNet Fellows have been asked to speak all over the world    recently because we are now acknowledged as an international example of a &#39;<strong>community    of practice</strong>&#39;. Wenger and Lave first used this term when their focus    was harnessing learning in business (Lave 1988). They began to think about the    community learning process in education in the late 1990s when the term &#39;community    of practice&#39; was becoming well established (Wenger 1998; Wenger, McDermott et    al. 2002).</p> <p>The draft paper about the Fellowship looks at Bronwyn Stuckey&#39;s study of 10    &#39;communities of practice&#39; spanning a range of professions. Bronwyn is now a    Fellow in her own right. She found that MirandaNet had all the elements which    are necessary for developing a successful community of practice, namely the    ability to:</p> <ul>   <li> Celebrate rituals of community life</li>   <li>Provide news and events that are constantly changing</li>   <li>Develop both public and private spaces</li>   <li>Invite different levels of participation</li>   <li>Harness the power of the personal connection</li>   <li> Generate content actively</li>   <li>Develop an active and passionate core</li> </ul> <p>(Stuckey 2005)</p> <p>I&#39;ve planned two papers: 1955-1998 and 1999-2006. In the first one I&#39;ve looked    at the operation of &#39;an active and passionate core&#39;. It is mostly about my learning    journey in founding MirandaNet. I&#39;d like comments about this history which I    can weave into the text. Go to the &#39;<a href="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/cgi-bin/journals/search_ej.pl?runtype=news;ejtype=tar">Teachers    as Researchers E-Journal</a>&#39; (<a href="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/cgi-bin/journals/search_ej.pl?runtype=news;ejtype=tar">http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/ejournal</a>)    and look up the Case Study, or find it via the People link.</p> <p><strong>Building a dynamic knowledge base 1998 - 2006</strong></p> <p>The second episode is from 1999-2006. It is about the iterative practice based    learning cycle that was first introduced to us by Bridget Somekh and Niki Davis    (1998). John Cuthell and I are tracing the ways in which we are learning together    over time like sharing the views of other Fellows to help to enrich the service    we provide to each other. For example, Rupert Wegerif, who is newly appointed    as a professor at Exeter University, began a dialogue with John Cuthell and    myself about the characteristics of the Fellowship that support teachers&#39; learning    last year at the World Conference for Computers in Education, in South Africa    . Rupert&#39;s comments have helped to identify one of the unique features of the    MirandaNet community. &quot;The outstanding feature of MirandaNet Fellows is    their critical engagement with the issues as well as the evidence of effective    practice.&quot;</p> <p>In this context we are particularly proud of Nigel Riley and Keith Turvey who    have proved this by published key papers in the latest editions of Technology,    Pedagogy and Education and Computers in Education. They show that teachers can    influence the thinking of education professionals by publishing in these highly    respected journals. However, getting to this academic standard takes time and    effort. Our members can publish their first evidence and ideas in a more teacher-friendly    style in the MirandaNet Braided Learning ejournal. You will also find Nigel    and Keith&#39;s early evidence for their journal papers in the MirandaNet &#39;Teachers    as Researchers&#39; volume, because they began this intellectual journey in a MirandaNet    practice-based course.</p> <p>The circular aspect of group learning where the learners become valued researchers    in their own right is what many Fellows are now implementing in their classrooms.    Nigel and Keith&#39;s papers are now influencing MirandaNet thinking about learning    in e-communities and about the value of concept mapping as an assessment tool    .</p> <p>More about this next time from John Cuthell and I as we are engaged in an ethnographical    investigation about how far Fellows have advanced the concept of a &#39;community    of practice&#39; to become a &#39;community of professional influence.&#39; (The term ethnographical    refers to the fact that we are members of the community and therefore acknowledge    out bias. On the other hand people from outside the Fellowship will not know    some of the more elusive aspects of membership).</p> <p>John and I are collecting examples of the influence we have had on ICT policy    locally, nationally and internationally since 1992 when Miranda Net was founded.    For example, the Toshiba scholarships were the impetus for the NCET portables    research into teacher ownership. Fellows also engaged in the recent DfES consultation    about learning by providing evidence from classrooms. In addition, Fellows have    influenced policy through practice in several countries where we have worked.    We are, for example, collecting evidence of this kind of learning cycle from    our Interactive Whiteboard project in Mexico where real efforts are being made    to transform teaching and learning. </p> <p>John and I would like to hear any anecdotes you have about MirandaNet practice    in action that we can publish this in a paper about modes of social learning    in the MirandaNet Fellowship. We will start a discussion about this on MirandaLink    next week.</p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Lave, J. (1988). Cognition in Practice.

The 2005 curtain-raiser    was Robert Ballard who discovered the Titanic, so Douglas chose to follow this    by exploring whether technology could &#39;save&#39; mathematics and science teaching    - subjects which are in perilous decline in most countries of the world. After    exploring the fascinating history of the subjects through web sites (including    the amazing 1.2km water tunnel on the island of Samos built in 550BC which was    started at both ends), the 2000 delegates were treated to a roller-coast ride    of resources that could add a sparkle to any lesson, and this included a look    at the 3D geometry involved in today&#39;s animated movies. It was not all hi-tech    - half way through Douglas had them all making a perfect tetrahedron from any    rectangular piece of paper!</p> <h3> A<a name="review" title="review"></a> review of the SITE 2006 Conference</h3> <p>Mechelle De Craene</p> <p>The thing that really interested me the most at the conference as a teacher    was The SimSchool. It&#39;s a video game that prepares future teachers. However,    I think there could be so many potential uses for this tool. For example, the    tool could be used to teach social skills to students with disabilities. I would    love to try it out with my students with autism to see what kind of virtual    world they would create. I&#39;m going to e-mail them about it. It seems really    interesting!!!! (Contacts: Melanie Zibit, Bill Halverson) <br />   <a href="http://simschool.org/index.htm">http://simschool.org/index.htm</a></p> <p>Additionally, I enjoyed learning about how teachers are using ICT in other    countries. One professor Mike Orey, Tel Amiel, Ho McClendon University of Georgia.    I thought this was a really interesting project. <br />   <a href="http://www.waet.uga.edu/">http://www.waet.uga.edu</a></p> <p>I liked learning more about Podcasting. </p> <p>Additionally Mathwrite: An Exploration of Touch Screen Mathematics in the European    Primary Classroom paper by: Bryn Holmes <br />   <a href="http://www.mathwrite.genadios.com/">http://www.mathwrite.genadios.com</a></p> <p>Additionally, John and my presentation was entitled: Re-programming Piaget:    A Developmental Look at ICT and 21st Century Learning. We got some good responses    from people from all over the globe which was really encouraging.</p> <p> Digital Storytelling was a big theme at the conference. Joe Lambert gave a    talk on it. I wish I would have gotten to hear it though...because I&#39;m making    an iMovie with my kids on biomes. Currently, we are in the storyboard phase    and will be using United Streaming in our digital stories. We are having the    kids write the scripts, do the camera work and tell us which film clips they&#39;d    like to incorporate in the iMovie from United Streaming. Additionally, my school    just bought Inspiration. We are going to have the kids make concept maps to    help them with their storyboards for digital storytelling....I&#39;m keeping a log    along the way...it&#39;s really fun. But I digress. </p> <p>Back to SITE...There&#39;s an audiostream of Janet Swenson&#39;s keynote &#39;Can you hear    me Now?: Composing Connections between Classroom&#39;s and Communities&#39;. It&#39;s on    the SITE site and there to click on. <br />   <a href="http://www.aace.org/conf/site/site_live.htm">http://www.aace.org/conf/site/site_live.htm</a></p> <h3> T<a name="prague" title="prague"></a>he workshop in Prague - 19th - 23rd February 2007</h3> <p>Please book in your diary the dates of the next MirandaNet workshop in Prague    - 19th - 23rd February 2007. </p> <p>There will be family prices for rooms including the weekends. We will probably    be staying in Prague 6, which is like the Kensington of Prague. School visits    will be in this district as well. It is about 10 mins from the centre on the    underground. </p> <p>Draft programme: 19th /20th schools visits, 21st/22nd ICT CPD workshop linked    to visits, 23rd public seminar and poster session. We have more planning meetings    at the end of April and should then have firm prices.</p> <h3>N<a name="new" title="new"></a>ew Fellows and Scholars</h3> <p><strong>Maria Kingham</strong> </p> <p>Maria has a mix of professional and technical skills in ICT, training and knowledge    management assisting in the &#39;acquire, order and dissemination of information&#39;.

My undergraduate degree was in primary school teaching at the University    of Cyprus during 2000-2004. In the year 2004-2005 I worked as a substitute teacher    and as a part time teacher in primary schools in Cyprus. Currently, I am undertaking    my master degree at the University of Nottingham in MA in ICT in Education.    I perceive ICT an important and auxiliary &#39;tool&#39; for promoting new approaches    in education for better, easier and more effective teaching and learning. I    am interested in implementing ICT in my teaching and potentially aim to incorporate    ICT in the educational system of Cyprus, by transferring my knowledge there.    I am currently working in my dissertation topic, &#39;The use of ICT in Cypriot    primary schools: Factors governing its implementation by teachers&#39;. My objectives    are: (1) explore teachers&#39; use of ICT in their teaching (2) identify factors    that influence their teaching behaviour regarding ICT (3) provide suggestions    and practical guidelines to policy makers and school administrators to devise    steps towards computer technology implementation.</p> <p><strong>Li Yuan</strong></p> <p>ICT Interests <br />   My main interests include the design and production multimedia teaching and    learning resources in educational settings, virtual learning community, teacher    professional development on ICT, the use of computers in the classroom, ICT    policy for schools at national, regional and international levels.</p>
