A brand new site is available from our original URL <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/">mirandanet.ac.uk</a>, but you will be able to browse this archive version (which itself contains archive material!) for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><strong>And it is not an entirely 'dead' archive!</strong> Most of the links which display old Members' details have been de-activated, along with the joining and logging in routines. The case studies and articles are still live, but can only be edited by the Admin. If any member wishes to withdraw their permission for any published item on the site, please contact the editor using the link below.</p>
<p>The main focus of MirandaNet now is the new site, where news and diary items will be published.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has supported me in my editorship of this wonderful organisation over the past 15 years. It is time to hand over to younger blood.</p>
<p><a href="mailto:editor@mirandanet.org.uk">Francis Howlett</a><br />Former MirandaNet Editor<br />10th May 2015</p><hr /><p><strong>7 May 2015</strong></p><h2>Tablets for Teachers!</h2><p><strong>David Fuller</strong>, one of our senior Fellows, is now a trainer for the <strong>Tablet Academy</strong>, who are MirandaNet associates. He’s just let me know that whereas teachers pay <strong>£105</strong> to attend the Tablet Academy regional roadshows, they take away a free Windows tablet of choice worth <strong>£170</strong>. Some schools send several teachers where they have a strategic plan to bring in tablets in the next academic year.<br /> <br /> The roadshows are being held in Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Leicester, London, Cornwall Norwich, Reading and Blackpool from May and I’ve seen good reports from teachers. More information here: <a href="http://www.tablet-academy.com/win8edutour.html">www.tablet-academy.com/win8edutour.html</a>. They also do free professional development workshops in London in the use of tablets in school. Call Tablet Academy on +44 (0) 1384 573330</p>
<p>If you want to know more about the use of tablets in schools, David has published a study, Pop Up Classroom, making things simple with tablets, about Roadshow follow-up support in schools in Brighton <a href="../casestudies/313.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/casestudies/313</a>.</p>
<p>We will also be publishing studies about Flipped Learning underpinned by the use of tablets in the Knowledge Hub on our beta site (ready soon).</p><hr /><p><strong>2 May 2015</strong></p><h2><a href="news.php%EF%B9%96Recno=304.html">Joint International Conference Slovenia, 28th - 30th May 2015</a></h2><p>Joint International Conference<br /> <em>Managing Sustainable Growth<br /> </em>Organised by University of Primorska, Faculty of Management, Slovenia<br /> Professor Christina Preston and Dr Sarah Younie <br /> on <br /> Taking the Tablets Transforming teaching, liberating learners and engaging the community<br /> Innovations in technology that enhance teaching and learning</p>

The consultation is designed to find out if there is enough professional support for an independent College of Teaching based on research into internationally acclaimed education systems in Singapore, South Korea, Shanghai and in Finland. This will be given DfE backing if there is enough grassroots support and financial backing. MirandaNet have pledged some money already.<br /> <br /> Responses to these questions by Wednesday 28th. <br />  <br /> Q1. What are the greatest impediments teachers and schools face in regularly undertaking high-quality professional development?<br /> Q2. To what extent, and how, do teachers currently evaluate their professional development? What would support more rigorous evaluation?<br /> Q3. Where should the balance of responsibility lie between teachers, schools and Government for ensuring that appropriate professional development is undertaken? How, in the longer term, might responsibility sit with a new independent professional body?<br /> Q4. Despite the growing reach of the Teaching Schools network, are there areas where coverage of schools would remain a concern? How could any gaps be addressed?<br /> Q5. What should the funding criteria be for Teaching Schools wishing to draw on the new funding pot for professional development? Should there, for example, be a requirement for Teaching Schools to work with a predetermined proportion of schools which are not already “good” or “outstanding”?<br /> Q6. Will teachers benefit from an online platform that collates and presents evidence-based best practice?<br /> Q7. In addition to the proposals outlined here, what other approaches would help schools to remove barriers and incentivise effective professional development for teachers?<br />  <br /> Please fill in your contributions here:<br /> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/ZVYZTFV">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/ZVYZTFV</a><br /> </span><br /> You can read the full background to the DfE consultation and download the consultation document here:<br /> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/developing-the-teaching-profession-to-a-world-class-standard">https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/developing-the-teaching-profession-to-a-world-class-standard</a></span><br /> <!--[endif]--></p><hr /><p><strong>15 January 2015</strong></p><h2><a href="news.php%EF%B9%96Recno=300.html">MirandaNet at BETT15</a></h2><h1 class="entry-title">BETT 2015</h1>

<p>The four organisers of this event, and the organisations to which they belong, share a common interest about how we could seek to develop tomorrow's successful digital citizens. The day will involve a series of short presentations, discussions and panels. It is also anticipated that some attendees may be able to join online.</p><hr /><p><strong>24 November 2014</strong></p><h2>MirandaNetter from Pakistan visits England</h2><p>Lubna Bashir Malik enjoyed a full programme of school visits and workshops when she visited England in October. Lubna, an Educational Technology Trainer from the City School System in Lahore, Pakistan, enjoyed her experience. "This was a great learning experience for me to take back to Pakistan where using technology in education creates a buzz. I feel interacting with different learning communities not only helps us to exchange ideas but it also brings us nearer to sharing thinking patterns. I learnt much from the <em>What the Research Says</em> session at the London Knowledge Lab about the potential and impact of Technology Enhanced Learning(TEL) and about the potential of partnerships between practitioners, industry and the research community. Although teachers are the main force in creating a meaningful learning environment I realised that building a social capital network will enable them not only to keep pace with the change but also to be the source of change. The second session at the LKL about planning lessons and courses with pedagogy in mind opened a wide array of perspectives within my own context and for education in Pakistan also."</p>

<p>This what the research event explores, discusses and debates: how can teachers use old and new learning technology to drive learning innovation and discover what works and why? What is the potential and impact of technology on teaching and learning experience? What is the evidence that pedagogies using technology help us learn any better?  What are students’ expectations of learning through technology? How might we facilitate students to reflect on the role of technology when learning?</p>
<p>MirandaNet will be debating the research they have done with  IRIS Connect, LightSpeed and Groupcall in particular who will demonstrate their products along with BrainPop, Tablet Academy and EU Handson ICT.</p>
<p>The event will include more presentations, demos and discussions to exchange experiences of the challenges faced in education, and to test how well and where technology help teachers to discover and create innovative learning experiences. And what is the view of the students? Are they equipped to get the best out of this kind of learning?</p>
<p>What does the evidence tell us about the types of teaching and learning taking place?</p>
<p>What is “it” that makes a difference to classroom and online teaching learning?</p>
<p>What are students’ learning expectations from digital technology? What are teachers’ learning expectations of digital technology?</p>

<h3>MirandaNet members have done more for the ETAGs submission to the three UK Ministers than was probably required. In fact, we have not only submitted to ETAGs but created a website of though- pieces and an overview of where members think policy should be heading in the future based on our collaborative past and present knowledge and experience.</h3>
<p>Many thanks to the members who joined in the face to face and online knowledge creation events. If we do nothing else but start the process of creating, supporting and participating in creation of a large scale data hub for Education based on the principals of data management services for advancing teaching and learning this will be a huge contribution. This critical paradigm shift will enable the UK to maintain and be Education leaders. However, this decision requires putting education, the learners and the teaching professionals centre stage. Building around such decisions, such as CPD, shared knowledge and practice through the large communities and networks that exist will be essential. Any systems set in place must work beyond a particular government.</p>
<p>Education and its needs are long term and if nothing else is possible then resources built by society should be accessible by the society if they are to bring national and international benefit.</p>
<p>Such a change in policy setting will require privacy and citizen rights of access and protection of use to be set at the foundation. Companies and governments making inappropriate use of the data should be held to the highest accountability.</p><hr /><p><strong>9 June 2014</strong></p><h2><a href="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/researchexchange/meetings-2014/">ETAGS submission meeting on June 13th at London Knowledge Lab</a></h2><p>The four topics are: connected institutions; servers and infrastructure;understanding and accrediting learning; and the wild cards.

Successful Education Policies, Resources and Technologies. She will be talking about <em>Lessons from the MirandaNet Fellowship</em> that she founded in 1992. Her topics will be the MirandaNet heritage as well as the future of this professional organisation. A key point that she will make is about the value of the website to educators all over the world. Around 205 unique visitors visiting the site each day, each making an average of two visits and viewing an average of over 11 pages. This is an unusually high number for such a site. Some of our visitors are clicking away an extraordinary number of times. The relatively low number of hits compared to the relatively high number of pages is also evidence of the high number of pages viewed per visit: the average number of hits per visitor is around 10, whereas a single page view on MirandaNet would typically have between 20 and 30 hits. MirandaNet members are engaged in a redesign of the website. In the future they plan to post even more information from members about digital technologies in teaching and learning that will increase the readership who are keen to read the views of practitioners. <em><a href="../ftp/LondonBookFair2014.ppt">Download Christina's PowerPoint Presentation</a></em> (3MB).</p><hr /><p><strong>18 February 2014</strong></p><h2><a href="../associates/mesh_spelling.htm">MESH Spelling Guide - Invitation to Participate</a></h2><p>A worldwide network of teachers and university teacher educators is experimenting with publishing information about effective teaching in a new form to support teachers (in training or experienced) in accessing quality assured research-based knowledge throughout their career.

<p>MirandaNet Fellows have been working with Graham Newell at IRIS Connect on a small pilot study on web-based video. Evidence is emerging on how this kind of system can have an impact on the effectiveness of professional development programmes and on pupil achievement.</p>
<p>Impressive results were observed by teachers themselves in the following key areas: a sense efficacy; confidence; professional collaboration; sharing; developing professional capital through communities of practice. Most importantly, the teachers were expressing, almost unanimously, pride in taking ownership of their own learning agenda.</p>
<p>In addition, evidence appears, even in these early stages, showing that half of these professionals already perceive that the improvements in their own professional practice are having some impact on their pupils’ performance and behaviour. These results provide valuable evidence for school to consider if they want to improve the quality of teaching, raise standards and utilise pupil premium effectively.</p>
<p>Overall, there are high levels of agreement amongst the ninety-nine teachers who have used this web-based video over a month for improving their own practice and performance. This level of agreement suggests that this innovative video tool should be considered for use in school based professional development programmes where ever possible and appropriate.</p>
<p>We are interested in applications for volunteers for a second stage of research. In this stage we will analyse the questionnaire data in more depth and triangulate these perceptions with other measures. The aim of this second stage will be to look more deeply into the potential of the IRIS Connect intervention to improve pupil achievement. It will investigate in depth the practices in schools where improvements are already measureable in the areas of SEN, Inclusion and overall behaviour.</p>

Major findings were that teachers want and need continuing professional development (CPD) in relation to their knowledge of learning platform uses both technically and pedagogically, but this support and training is patchy and not always available at the time of need, in contrast to provision in universities. With respect to barriers: inter-operability problems between commonly used management information systems and the learning platforms were reported as hindering development of practice. In university/school partnerships, a key finding is that access rights to university platforms by school partners and to school learning platforms by university partners are limited, which is an issue surrounding the successful outworking of learning platforms.<br /><br />You can find a free eprint of the journal paper <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/rTxauYsG2KJChvRmErHe/full">here.</a></p><hr /><p><strong>1 July 2013</strong></p><h2><a href="../researchexchange/events-2/bedford-itte-conference-8th-10th-july-2013/mirandanet-symposia-at-itte/index.html">MirandaNet Programme for ITTE Conference (July 9th)</a></h2><p><strong>Our programme <br /></strong>The programme on July 9th starts with three MirandaNet symposia These activities provide us with an opportunity to understand members&rsquo; points of view and use them to influence policy on the use of digital technologies in education especially the new Computing Curriculum.

<li><strong>Will the new &lsquo;Computing&rsquo; curriculum in England be more relevant for children&rsquo;s futures than the old one?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In this context, the symposia are designed to come to a group view about the most important issues on the topic that have been will raised when they consider all the speakers&rsquo; perspectives.</p>
<p>Threaded through all the symposia will be a theme of creativity in learning using digital technologies concluding with a MirandaMod.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Pedagogy and Creativity<br /></strong>In the MirandaMod we will ask colleagues to concentrate on ways in which digital technologies can be used to promote creative thinking and practice in schools.</p>
<p><strong>Joining details<br /></strong>Theo kuechel (theo.kuechel at gmail.com) will provide information on Mirandalink and Twitter on how to log on to &nbsp;the live video stream, the connections for the concept map and how to join in the MirandaMod online in Google Hangouts. There are only six places &nbsp;for contributors -&nbsp;&nbsp;let Theo know if you want to speak. &nbsp;Of course the &nbsp;Hangout will be broadcast live and anyone can watch from anywhere, and will also be&nbsp;available&nbsp;on YouTube after the event.</p>

This interview at the opening the four-day international MirandaNet Fellowship event, <em>Exploring Education Futures, </em>in London&rsquo;s Docklands at the end of January, was sponsored by GroupCall, a MirandaNet associate. An amusing and eloquent speaker, Bob regretted that he had gained very little from school. Poetry excited him in English lessons and he can still recite passages he learnt now. But otherwise he found that he had little interest in other subjects and failed to pass any examinations. He admitted he was not easy to manage in school, but also felt that teachers should try to accommodate pupils with his special gifts rather more sympathetically than they treated him. <a href="../bett/bett13/geldof.htm"><em>Read more...</em></a></p><hr /><p><strong>10 December 2012</strong></p><h2><a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/researchexchange/events-2/exploring-education-futures/">BETT13 Programme</a></h2><p>Wednesday 30th January</p>

<p>Following the amazing success of the July MirandaMod, MirandaNet Fellows and friends gathered once more, on November 27<sup>th</sup> at the Work-Related Learning Centre of Excellence at the Institute of Education, in London.&nbsp; Introduced by Christina Preston, and ably and warmly chaired by the inimitable Drew Buddie, delegates were treated to a truly amazing display of state-of -the-art projects and thinking.</p>
<p>These included an introductory, keynote presentation written by Vanessa Pittard, Becta (given in her absence by Christina), and a fascinating insight into visual learning by Rachel Jones, Steljes.&nbsp; We listened to how we could use Google Earth for creative writing (which I, as a teacher of English, found particularly exciting and innovative); about&nbsp; best classroom practice in using ICT; about cross-agency links through a Healthy Eating project; about solving conceptual, and management problems in ICT classes; about new ways of using Moodle, and much more beside.</p>
<p>Throughout the event, MirandaNetters contributed comments and questions from the floor of the WLE, while others watching the webcast were able to do the same via Twitter, and an even greater number of \"lurkers\" (or \"active listeners\") globally formed part of this new kind of \"un\" conference.&nbsp; All of this was accompanied by two vital ingredients: beer and sandwiches. (Thanks, Steljes!).</p>
<p>We hope that those who contributed from Germany, the Czech Republic, New Zealand, and elsewhere had as good a time as we did, and learned as much.&nbsp; Some events are transforming: this was certainly one of them.</p><hr /><p><strong>12 September 2008</strong></p><h2><a href="../associates/tribal.htm">Tribal: changing the culture</a></h2><p>We are pleased to announce that we have a  new association with Tribal who are developing innovative CPD programmes with  MirandaNet for schools in the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) initiative.

Schools must have the ICT Mark to enter this category. This  year this category will be awarded regionally, as well as nationally.  <br /> <br /><strong>Learning Experience</strong> &ndash; this covers curriculum, assessment,  learning and teaching.  This should be for practice that happens in the  classroom or in the school day, as part of the pupil&rsquo;s experience of learning.   This can cover day to day teaching, target setting and review, curriculum, ICT  capability etc etc.<br /> <br /><strong>Beyond the Classroom</strong> &ndash; deals with any work  with ICT that happens outside the average school day and, as such, covers stuff  like partnerships between schools and other organisations, delivering extended  learning opportunities to pupils.  It also covers home access work (both in  terms of kit in the home and also access to learning from home or other  locations through learning platforms and learning environments &ndash; VLEs) and  parental engagement.  It depends on schools working with as wide a community as  possible to improve learning in and outside schools.  <br /> <br /><strong>Leadership,  Management and Collaboration</strong> &ndash; focuses on the way ICT is led and managed at  a high level in the school and may include some, all or none of: work like  management information systems to process data more efficiently, bold leadership  decisions in terms of financing ICT developments, inclusion of various parts of  the wider school community in the development and adoption of strategies around  ICT.  One part that must be addressed is how the school is supporting and  collaborating with other schools to help them develop their practice with ICT.   <br /> <br /><strong>Support for schools</strong> - this is for organisations who support  schools in their implementation of ICT.  This can include local authorities (or  teams within them), industry suppliers, training providers, organisations  running projects with schools etc etc. Anyone who isn&rsquo;t a school or  DCSF-registered education provider should look at this category.<br /> <br />If  encouraging anyone to enter, please tell them to make sure they present all  their evidence against the criteria on the application form, as judges will only  use the application form content when making shortlisting decisions.  <br /> <br />For more detail please see ICT Excellence Awards website at  <a href="http://www.becta.org.uk/excellenceawards">www.becta.org.uk/excellenceawards</a>   <br /> <br />Any queries, comments, suggestions?

Dr. Dan Sporea Head of the Laser Metrology and Standardisation Laboratory in Bucharest, was calling for papers for an international Workshop &ldquo;Science Education in Schools&rdquo; to be held in Bucharest.</p><p>At Holy Cross School, Lawrence Williams took up the challenge, and submitted a paper about his &ldquo;Science Through Arts&rdquo; project, which, following Federal budget cuts, had moved from the USA to Taiwan. Conference dates in Romania were a problem, and so, in a &ldquo;first&rdquo; for MirandaNet, Lawrence gave his paper there without actually leaving the UK! Instead, a PowerPoint presentation was sent to Bucharest, together with the paper, and Dr. Sporea kindly gave the presentation on his behalf.</p><p>Dan and Lawrence are now working together on new ways of developing student collaboration on science education, in the UK and Romania.

</p><hr /><p><strong>10 June 2007</strong></p><h2><a href="news.php.html">London Schools to get Managed Learning Environment ahead of Government targets (from Naace news)</a></h2>London schools are set to benefit from a Managed Learning Environment (MLE) through a framework contract procured by the London Grid for Learning (LGfL), three years ahead of Government targets. The MLE, provided by Fronter UK Ltd, will give pupils and teachers their own web space, enabling pupils to work on assignments, share advice and materials with their peers and submit work online. Teachers can monitor their students&#39; progress throughout, offering guidance and marking their work online, without losing those aspects of personalised learning environments that allow pupils to exert control over their own learning.<br /> <br /> Following a comprehensive evaluation conducted within Becta&#39;s Learning Services Framework*, the framework contract has been awarded to leading learning platform provider Fronter UK Ltd. The London MLE, powered by Fronter comprises 90 tools and will enable school users to benefit from discussion boards, instant messaging and 200 MB of web space each. Pupils and teachers can get access to the latest news with RSS feeds and they can even create online brainstorms for lessons. Teachers will be able to tailor individual learning plans to help personalise learning with the MLE, creating bespoke lessons that are accessible online.<br /> <br /> The MLE will enhance teaching and learning across London&#39;s 2,584 maintained schools by providing the consistent delivery and management of e-learning. This continuity of learning enabled by ICT is important for London, which has the highest annual teacher turnover and pupil movement rate in the country. Students and teachers will be able to access their work online in their new school easily once transferred.<br /> <br /> Teachers can use the MLE to create learning pathways; a piece of work containing several different completion routes to account for individual learning styles and ranges of ability. This can be tailored to the needs of their students, further personalising the learning experience. Learning pathways also ensure inclusion as all pupils are able to complete the work.<br /> <br /> Brian Durrant, Chief Executive of the LGfL, said: &quot;Not content with just maintaining the status quo, an MLE was the next logical step for London. This collaboration by London LAs and a commitment to learning, combined with Fronter&#39;s expertise has made this vision possible three years ahead of the government&#39;s target. We hope that London schools will be national trailblazers in making personalised learning enabled by ICT a reality&quot;<br /> <br /> Twice winners of the highly-acclaimed European Seal of Excellence in Multimedia Award, Fronter is due to roll out its MLE across London Schools from September 2007. Roger Larsen, Founder and CEO of Fronter UK Ltd, said: &quot;We anticipate an exciting future for education and look forward to working with the London Grid for Learning to realise this across London.&quot;<br /> <hr /><p><strong>19 April 2007</strong></p><h2><a href="news.php.html">New report from The Princes Trust</a></h2><p>A jobless generation of young people is costing the UK economy billions in lost productivity and crime, according to a joint report published by The Prince&rsquo;s Trust and The Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS).</p><p>The Cost of Exclusion warns that youth unemployment is costing the UK economy a staggering &pound;10 million a day in lost productivity.

I am an Israeli scholar working in the  various areas of the IT and education. 
For the last 6 years I have been implementing a program which I initiated: The Intergenerational Connection: Preserving Heritage in a Technological Society, in more than 400 schools in Israel. <p>
In this program children ages 10-16 tutor seniors in their community at internet and computer skills. The seniors in their turn tell their young teachers a chapter from their personal history: together they scan albums, documents, letters, meaningful objects and artifacts, listen to music and songs the senior used to listen to, search the internet, browse libraries etc... 
Together they write a computerized version of the seniors chapter and upload it to the internet. 
The young teachers bring their technological expertise and the seniors their vast experience and their own history. The program is tri-stages, each stage comes with a very detailed guide book and a CD including templates. <p>

MirandaNet is an international fellowship that networks leaders of information and communication technologies (ICT). We use technology to support our networking across England and other countries of the world. But how does the use of technology to communicate vary to show respect for every participant's culture? Is it possible to model good inter-cultural practice for our students and colleagues in education in our countries?
<p>
These are just two of the questions being debated by our ILET project's international reading group. The group will move its discussion from the SITE forums in the USA to MirandaNet in the UK on October 16 for strand 2.

<i>The following report appeared in NAACE</i> <i>News on June 21st 2002</i><p>
Since the Velvet Revolution The MirandaNet Fellows have been working in collaboration with Czech teachers and teacher educators on the use of ICT to promote new alliances in international citizenship adn professional growth and change.  Lenka Zernova, a Czech Miranda Fellows, observed, "After long period of political isolation our Czech teachers can gain from seeing how other teachers work and share their concerns and interests.  We are most interested in learning about collaborative and constructive learning which includes understanding democratic procedures and processes."<p>

As a result of MirandaNet Fellowship work, Christina will be awarded the Trnokova medal from the Czech Technical University on June 20th in Prague.  Understanding how professional organisations function has been a new slant on post totalitarian freedom for the Czech teachers and teacher educators. NAACE accepted the applications of two MirandaNet Fellows in 1996.  Visits to NAACE conferences and advice from members has been influential in the Czechs decision this year to set up a similar organisation to fight a new kind of threat to educational freedom in the Czech Republic - commercial totalitarianism.

A UK/US professional development programme <p>
The MirandaNet Fellowship has been invited to organise a pilot exchange between UK and US teachers. The focus of the visit will be the transformation of teaching and learning using ICT as a change catalyst. MirandaNet Fellows and LEA advisors will mentor the teachers in their exploration of the technology. Pre-visit connections between the teachers will be facilitated by the use of Oracle’s Think.com web based learning environment where classroom projects will also be developed. 

10 US teachers will visit schools the UK for three weeks in the second half of the summer term 2002. Ten UK teachers will then go to the Washington area for 3 weeks at the beginning of the autumn half term holiday or in late August. Teachers will stay in each others’ homes, visit schools, discuss educational issues and work on curriculum exchange projects and ICT management. Each teacher will help develop a web based exchange project between the UK and the US schools and will publish a case study online as information for other teachers. 

Travel costs are met by the UK but the schools are responsible for organising the accommodation and any support cover required. Fares for these Fulbright Scholarships will be paid by the DFES, British Council and the US state department. Hartlepool LEA is offering support cover and Oracle is providing the web based learning environment, Think.com, that the teachers and children will use to communicate and to publish their work. Plans are being made for a second year of exchanges. It is hoped that some teachers will then elect to do a year’s exchange with their foreign partner. 

If this visit is successful more Fulbright exchanges will be based on this model.

MirandaNet has just begun a project in collaboration with TeacherNet at the Department for Education to increase teachers' awareness of the National Grid for Learning resources, to promote ownership of this new medium and to consult with teachers by peer review.  

This process will be a celebration of teachers' existing work on the Web and a promotion of resource development by teachers for teachers. 

The first phase of this project is a pre-pilot to be completed by March which will focus on the provision of lesson plans on the internet.  A web site will be created by teachers for teachers on The DfEE TeacherNet site representing the outcomes of the pre-pilot.  A number of MirandaNet Fellows are heading up teams to evaluate existing lesson plans.  

We are looking for web surfers to evaluate teachers' web resources on the NGfL in the short term and the long term.  This is an opportunity for fees for something that many teachers want to be doing anyway.
