    <p><strong>6 December 2007</strong></p>
<p><strong>December Newsletter</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editorial</strong></p> <p>Dear MirandaNetters,</p> <p>Well done to all our MirandaNet authors who jumped all the academic hurdles to qualify for entry in the volume of Reflecting Education on multimodal concept mapping. This volume was produced in partnership with the Institute of Education, University of London. Teachers who want to develop their academic credentials and improve their work based learning in this subject will find this volume very useful. However, it took two years to publish this volume because of the high academic standards that had to be achieved. Well done to our members who achieved publication.</p> <p>What militates against this kind of academic writing is the time it takes to express these complex ideas in a polished way. The results are important to long term and proven developments in digital technologies because so much careful thinking has gone into their production. On the other hand,  MirandaNetters have vital information about digital technologies that needs to be communicated more quickly because the digital landscape is changing so fast. MirandaNetters also want to explore with others ideas that are only just forming. This is why our forums, MirandaLink and the ejournal Braided Learning platform are such crucial elements of membership because they provide instant sources of information and collaboration. Professionals use to traditional communication can feel challenged by these more informal and less polished publications so I am delighted to see so many more members getting involved in these online facilities.</p> <p>Judging from the number of visitors to our website it is clear that the practitioner case studies in our braided learning e-journals are greatly valued by professionals all over the world. These represent contributions which are between an email response and a full academic paper. We give support to any prospective author who asks because do not want to be a test of members&#39; ability against some external criteria, but a way of empowering all professional voices however they wish to express themselves. If you need support in preparing your Fellowship contributions please get in touch, especially if you have an idea for a multimedia or multimodal entry.</p> <p>In the context of our ejournals, Robin Bevan and Erin Antonius gain a Fellowship for their contribution to the  MirandaNet ejournal volume Mapping Inspiration (<a href="../ejournal/index.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/ejournal</a>). Ian Mursell will receive his Fellowship certificate for his contribution on Mexicolore and so will Maka Baramielze and Anita Bjelica for their report on their visit to Prague and the presentation they did with their pupils on World Ecitizens at the international BESA conference last January. Jane Shuyska for her Reflecting Education paper.</p> <p>We also have a new category of long-term participation award this year, Senior Fellow. This award has been created because many of our Fellows have continued to participate after their first Fellowship award in building global professional knowledge in the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning. Their commitment includes managing forums, participating in MirandaLink, giving seminars, writing conference papers, organising video conferences as well as continuing to publish in the e-journals. We wanted to celebrate the continuing efforts of these Fellows who have already gained their first Fellowship awards. Therefore, Senior Fellowship have been awarded to Christina Howell Richardson for editing the two MirandaNet volumes of Reflecting Education on E-learning and Mapping- also our multimodal concept mapping critical friends, Averil Loveless and Di Mavers</p> <p>Senior Fellowships also for papers in the two multimodal mapping ejournals for MirandaNetters: Sylvia Rojas-Drummond, Steven Coombs, Nigel Riley, Wilma Clarke and Jane Finch (<a href="http://www.reflectingeducation.net/">www.reflectingeducation.net</a> and <a href="../ejournal/index.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/ejournal</a>).</p> <p>We are finding that interviews provide us with the most immediate means of access to Senior Fellows&#39; expertise so you can already enjoy interviews with some of the 2008 crop of Senior Fellows. Andr&eacute;e Jordan, for example, talks about her awards for exchanges with other schools in a podcast <a href="../fellowship/senior.htm">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/fellowship/senior.htm</a>. Andr&eacute;e&#39;s Peace room for World Citizens will be launched at BETT08.</p> <p>We have also used the forum facility for these interview/discussions. Michael Smith talks about his inspirational journey through ICT CPD as part of the Visual Learning knowledge hub <a href="../visual/index.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/visual</a>. Lawrence Williams has provided information in the forums about his international exchanges and Dai Thomas talks to John Cuthell about his knowledge about Virtual Worlds. You can also join into the discussions in these forums which is an opportunity to exchange ideas with these experts <a href="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/phorum/index.php">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/phorum</a>.</p> <p>In 2008 we will also be interviewing more senior Fellows. Amongst them are Dughall McCormick, Jan Lepeltak, Niki Davis, Mara Chrystie, We&#39;d love to know if you would like to nominate a member for this award or the Basia Korczak Award. This year Mechelle De Craene was awarded The Basia Korczak Award for an outstanding contribution to global professional knowledge in the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning <a href="../profiles/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=480.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/profiles/profile.php?prof=480</a>. We also have a special MirandaNet award for Sean Dodson, the Guardian journalist, who joined us for our Etopia week in Prague and wrote a generous piece about our work (<a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/elearning/story/0,,2037510,00.html">http://education.guardian.co.uk/elearning/story/0,,2037510,00.html</a>).</p> <p>These new Senior Fellowship certificates for 2007 will be awarded along with the Fellow certificates at BETT08 on Thursday 10th January at 4:00pm on our stand: S97 All members who attend are welcome to join us at an early supper at about 6:30 p.m.</p> <p>Yours in Fellowship,</p> <p>Christina Preston</p> <p><strong>The news</strong></p> <p>This month&#39;s online forum: Virtual Worlds - in CPD</p> <p><em>Dai Thomas and John Cuthell</em></p> <p><a href="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/phorum/index.php">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/phorum</a></p> <p>You can see evidence of Dai Thomas&#39;s Senior Fellowship expertise in helping us building up our understanding of Virtual Worlds. As a result of his advice, MirandaNet has bought an island in Second Life. We would welcome members who join our forum to decide how to plan CPD events in this space.</p> <p>If you log in you will receive a message in your email when comments are added so that you can keep up with the discussion. Here are some extracts from the forum below.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Dai Thomas says:</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Pete Twinnings Schome project at the OU has seen some remarkable uses by the system by students to build architecture, to develop social rules and etiquette, to exchange art and clothing design or to talk about Second Life Physics and how this relates to real world physics such as gravity and mass. Other areas of SL have used the gaming aspects of VR to allow us to walk into an historical setting such as the American Civil war and role play reliving this history. There is a fantastic project which gives you an insight into schizophrenia.</p> <a href="http://secondlife.blogs.com/nwn/2004/09/in_the_minds_ey.html">http://secondlife.blogs.com/nwn/2004/09/in_the_minds_ey.html</a></blockquote> <blockquote> <p>&nbsp;<strong>John Cuthell says:</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>When we were talking about Second Life this evening and I realized something, that no matter how much you critique the application/site, you talk about events there - and events as if they&#39;re happening in the &#39;real world.&#39; What other environment generates such a self-created ongoing diegetic? Things falling from the sky, people griefing others, people wandering around, creating and destroying, talking and talking, maybe making a living. SL plays the &#39;real world,&#39; of course however defined. And that is its strength - semantics and content moving among ordinary subjectivities.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Reports on past events</strong></p> <p>(Please send us a report with your presentation about events that you are attending - many MirandaNetters cannot attend conferences and would be delighted to hear what you have been doing.)</p> <p><strong>Social networking between professionals - what is the point?</strong></p> <p>This paper uses braided learning theory to analyse the online discussion that occurred in the Naace forum on Portfolios. It was an eventful discussion as one of the members was removed from the forum because he would not follow the code of conduct. It is interesting to speculate on how so many professionals can be expected to support young people in online practice when they have so little experience themselves in this medium and little training in e-facilitation.</p> <p>Versions of this paper were presented in Amsterdam at the Taconet conference on 8th September by Jan Lepeltak and by Christina Preston at the Naace conference on Social Networking on November 5th in Tamworth. The latest version will be published by the Taconet European Network by the end of this year.</p> <p><strong>A new e-Community of Practice in Varberg, Sweden</strong></p> <p>The teachers of Varberg, a city in Sweden in the Province (or county) of Halland near Gothenburg (also G&ouml;teborg) have had a very traditional approach to education until recently. They have decided to transform their approach by using ICT in classrooms. However, the region is now asking the heads to act as leaders in a new impetus to transform teaching and learning using ICT. Since England is already in the middle of this transformational process, they hoped that the MirandaNet Fellowship would be able to help with building an e-community of practice (e-COP) amongst the practitioners. We expect to hear more from the heads as their new project progresses.</p> <p><strong>Handheld Learning 2007 Conference - see the video</strong></p> <p>Videos of all of the main plenary sessions, including the opening by Jim Knight and keynotes from Stephen Crowne and Marc Prensky, from the recent Handheld Learning 2007 Conference are now being uploaded to Handheld Learning TV which may be freely viewed at: <a href="http://handheldlearning.blip.tv/">http://handheldlearning.blip.tv</a></p> <p>Links to other materials including presentation slides, pictures and podcast maybe found via: <a href="http://www.handheldlearning.co.uk/content/view/41/2/">http://www.handheldlearning.co.uk/content/view/41/2/</a></p> <p>Graham Brown-Martin</p> <p><strong>Free Publications and Resources</strong></p> <p><strong>Latest volume of Reflecting Education on multimodal mapping</strong></p> <p>The latest issue of Reflecting Education has now been published and is available to read at <a href="http://www.reflectingeducation.net/">www.reflectingeducation.net</a>. This special issue, entitled &lsquo;Fascinating cultural objects: multimodal concept mapping in teaching and learning&#39;, focuses on the ways in which digital concept mapping can be used to support teaching and learning activities. Christina Preston and Christina Howell-Richardson (Associate Editors) were the associate editors with Avril Loveless and Di Mavers as critical friends. The volume features the work of MirandaNetters, Nigel Riley, Wilma Clarke, Sylvia Rojas- Drummond and Jane Shuyska. We have also included podcast of interviews with Tony Buzan and Gunther Kress as well as contributions from Ahlberg, Mavers, Novak and Canas who are leading experts in this field.  We&#39;ve already had a comment from member, Chrysoula Hadjichristou, who says that concept mapping is a very good and important teaching tool to organise the mind. She uses it to organise projects and so do her students from the primary to the secondary school. She congratulations MirandaNet Fellows on their work in this field.</p> <p>We would value your comments on this volume of research papers. What do you think of the index which is a concept map? Is this kind of research helpful to practitioners? What subject should we tackle next?</p> <p><a href="http://www.reflectingeducation.net/index.php/reflecting">www.reflectingeducation.net/index.php/reflecting</a></p> <p>You will find our companion practitioner volume about mapping in the MirandaNet Braided Learning ejournal - Mapping Inspiration. <a href="../casestudies/index.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/inspiration</a></p> <p><strong>Research-based professional development resources to support interactive whiteboard use in the secondary classroom</strong></p> <p><em><strong>The T-MEDIA research project</strong></em></p> <p>Four disks are available, at cost price, covering secondary English, maths, science and history, or as a fifth summary disk.</p> <p>The discs were produced in association with Caret, the University&#39;s Centre for Applied Research in Educational Technologies, and are available at cost price via a downloadable order form from the team&#39;s publications website:<a href="http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/istl">http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/istl</a>.

Just last week they have been voted as Women-friendly organisation of the region in 2007. Next to this project we are running Children TV, with close cooperation with Gymnasium F.X.Saldy where we want to go for ESF funding as well for improvement of Media literacy and Media courses for teachers so they can incorporate this as part of their teaching plans. Next to it we do run film event call Fresh Eyes, which shows children television production from all over CZ+SK with plans to go Europe wide (always searching for partners in this area, I plan to come over for BETT in January)... In fact this is very similar activity to BBC Blast!... Some of the videos can be seen at <a href="http://www.dtv-liberec.cz/porady.php">http://www.dtv-liberec.cz/porady.php</a>, and few of them are even with EN subtitles (<a href="http://dtv.lbc.cz/video/041108sf.rm">http://dtv.lbc.cz/video/041108sf.rm</a>)...</p> <p><strong>New Scholars</strong></p> <p><strong>Sheila Feasey</strong></p> <p>Having worked with children and young people for many years I am now a student in my third year of a BA in teacher training which qualifies me to work in either KS2 or 3. My specialism is ICT, and to date I have no qualifications within that field, having taught myself along the way, and more recently through lectures and seminars. I chose ICT, as I have had experience within the SEN sector, where I have witnessed how empowering ICT can be for students with communication difficulties. To date I am open-minded about my first teaching arena, finding all age ranges interest me. I am currently contemplating my dissertation idea. My current thoughts are to research how well non-ICT specialists are able (capability and resources) to incorporate ICT across the full subject range, or perhaps how authentic &#39;discrete&#39; ICT teaching can be and whether this is more motivational for students. In just two years of student teaching practice I have witnessed a range of teaching using ICT, and feel teacher capability and limited resources may have been restrictive. In other instances I have seen apathetic interest in &#39;rote&#39; instruction that had little relevance to the Year group. Food for thought.</p> <p><strong>Greg Scanlon</strong></p> <p>Full-time research post-grad student, investigating the potential of ICT to assess conceptual learning, in the Department of Education and Professional Studies, University of Limerick. Working with Dr Oliver McGarr, I have taken an existing course &quot;ICT in Education&quot; and changed it to an e-learning course with online assessment using Moodle, available at: <a href="http://paulo.ul.ie/">http://paulo.ul.ie/</a> (please contact me to get guest access). The course has been presented to first year student teachers each year since 2005 during the Spring semester with an average cohort of 280 and the data gathered from student surveys, formative assessment responses and student grades, will form the basis of my Masters thesis. The teacher-training programmes involved can be viewed at:<a href="http://www.ul.ie/education/programmes/index.html">http://www.ul.ie/education/programmes/index.html</a>.</p> <p>My interest in determining the usefulness of ICT in assessing conceptual learning is driven by the conviction that learning can be made so interesting that self-directed learning will be widely practised, by a large segment (a majority?) of the population. Does this mean that teaching will no longer be a recognised occupation? I don&#39;t think so, but the occupation of teaching will change to one of facilitating, so that learners will be facilitated in their search for learning.</p> <p><strong>Ilona Terescenco</strong></p> <p>In a fast-moving and knowledge-based society like ours it is extremely unwise and painful to stick to the so-called traditional methods both in learning or teaching. It is just like trying to swim against the tide. Young teachers in particular ought to adapt faster than ever and re-invent their teaching perspectives and methods. As a matter of fact a modern E-citizen ought to re-invent himself as well as his environment. Therefore, those who loathe and fear ICT will be swept away unawares. We must either adapt to ICT and incorporate it in our educational system or quit teaching!!!</p> <p>My best wishes to you all! Globalisation is not so fierce after all!</p> <p><strong>Paul Vale</strong></p> <p>I work as a freelance educational consultant specialising in ICT and using ICT to enhance teaching and learning. I have been increasingly involved in promoting and developing the use of safer web-sites for students and adults to use within virtual communities as a safer alternative to MySpace, Facebook, MSN Messenger, Piczu and the like.</p> <p>My current work includes leading an extended project funded by the Oracle Education Foundation using the web-medium <a href="http://www.think.com/">www.think.com</a>and contracted to edit Naace&#39;s Sharing Success fortnightly e-magazine and Primary Focus termly journal.</p> <p><strong>Karen Waterston</strong></p> <p>I am interested in how to use the technologies around us to enhance the learning and teaching experience. I&#39;m particularly interested in digital media and content, Interactive Whiteboards. I love finding new ideas especially ones which require minimal preparation but that go a long way.</p>
