  <p>1. THANKS TO SCHOOLSCAPE</p>
  <p>Thanks to our <a href="../schoolscape/laptops.htm">Schoolscape@Future</a> project 
    we are now able to provide regular news bulletins on MirandaNet colleagues 
    and their activities. This project which was secured by MirandaNetters <a href="../fellowship/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=143.html">Bryn 
    Holmes</a> and Marilyn Leask is funded by the EU Socrates Minerva initiative 
    which promotes the study of Open and Distance Learning and the use of ICT 
    in the field of Education. We are working with Portugal and Ireland.</p>
  <p>Please send any items you would like disseminated on the MirandaNet website
    to the News Bulletin Editor Anne Dobson.</p>

  <p>2. UPDATE ON THE MIRANDANET 10TH BIRTHDAY PARTY</p>
  <p><img src="../images/newsletters/nationalcostume.jpg" width="200" height="131" align="right" alt="Dancers from Prague">The 
    highlight of Miranda's 10th Birthday Party was the traditional dancing and 
    singing from our Czech colleagues. Zdenka, Boba and Lenka came in full costume, 
    from their National Theatre, and presented Tina with rye bread and salt in 
    an old ceremony which cements friendship. AND NOW WE HAVE THE PICTURES!</p>

  <p>3. MIRANDA's BIRTHDAY PRESENTS</p>
  <p><img src="../images/newsletters/collage.jpg" width="192" height="144" align="right" alt="The Collage">Miranda 
    received some delightful presents on her birthday from the Fellowship. Hung 
    in the office is a photo collage of our eight year Czech Miranda alliance. 
    A Renee Macintosh watch, a liberty silk scarf, a book of Art and Crafts in 
    Holland, an original page from Bryan Talbot's graphic novel, the Rat's Tale 
    that we are using in our City Citizens project, and many other treasures. 
    Tina thanks you for such unexpected thoughtfulness on Miranda's behalf. </p>

  <p>4. UK/CHINESE CURRICULUM EXCHANGE</p>
  <p>We would like to extend our appreciation and thanks to Actis and Promethean 
    who funded school visits and a reception at the Conrad Hilton Hotel for the 
    Chinese teachers at BETT03. It was particularly pleasing to have a mixed group 
    of heads and senior teachers as well as classroom teachers.</p>
  <p>Our thanks also go to the UK teachers, heads and the guides who hosted these 
    visits. The schools involved were Cheam School in Reading, Blue Gate Fields 
    Infants and Junior Schools in London, Waldegrave Girls School at Twickenham, 
    and Chafford Hundred Campus in Essex. Each of these schools put extra time 
    and effort into making the Chinese welcome and encouraged them to ask questions. 
    This time was very much appreciated by the visitors. </p>
  <p>We do not want these warm feelings of friendship and the opportunity for 
    long term exchanges to dissolve away. Most of the teachers had made excellent 
    contacts and had plans for projects. The MirandaNet Fellowship would like 
    to give these plans a boost by providing a MirandaNet web page for the Mulan 
    Community. WATCH THIS SPACE.</p>

    Christina Preston has written for the Times Educational Supplement about Chinese 
    Education</a>.</p>

  <p>5. NEW MIRANDANET SCHOLARS</p>
  <p>Francis has been kept busy in December and January sending out information 
    to new scholars. They come from fields as far apart as Tom Moore from Melton 
    Mowbray in the UK, Francis Olabampe from the Gambia in West Africa, Rob Clarke 
    from New Zealand now in the UK, Marie Gibbs from Bristol, Georgina Stein from 
    Canterbury in Kent, David DeShon from Michigan, USA and Shahjahan Siraj from 
    Bangladesh. We will be very interested the see the case studies on projects 
    these scholars will be providing as their qualifying route for Fellowship 
    status. </p>

  <p>6. CONGRATULATIONS TO ALASTAIR WELLS AND KEITH PHIPPS - TEACHERS OF THE YEAR 
    PRIZES @ BETT03</p>
  <p>Becta run an annual award system called the 'ICT in Practice' awards. There 
    are several award categories for Secondary, Primary, Management and tertiary 
    college practitioners. The Teaching award seeks to recognise innovative or 
    exemplary work which has impacted on pupils' learning. Nominees are nominated 
    each year with a closing date at the end of July.</p>
  <p><img src="../images/newsletters/phipps.jpg" width="130" height="119" align="right" alt="Keith Phipps">Nominations 
    are shortlisted by judges. In the secondary category both <a href="../fellowship/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=68.html">Alastair 
    Wells</a> and <a href="../fellowship/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=299.html">Keith Phipps</a> were 
    shortlisted amongst eight to be visited in their schools. The shortlist was 
    trimmed down to three. These people were then asked to make a presentation 
    before a large panel of judges at a hotel near Becta headquarters in Coventry.</p>
  <p><img src="../images/wells2.jpg" width="72" height="90" align="left" alt="Alastair Wells">Alastair 
    Wells was announced to be the joint winner of the secondary category and Keith 
    Phipps was announced as the runner up. They received their awards at the BETT 
    exhibition Olympia in London in January 2003.</p>
