<p>Jane Finch<br />Senior MirandaNet Fellow</p>
<h3>Members' News</h3>
<p><strong>Katya Toneva </strong><br />Senior Fellow<br />I have been working on a research project that was based on the e-facilitation course that John Cuthell ran a couple of years ago. This is a relatively new teaching/learning approach that used online forums to effect. This project has resulted in significant improvements in my A2 ICT students exam results.</p>
<p>The updated versions of my reports can be seen <a href="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/cgi-bin/journals/search_ej.pl?runtype=casedisplay;cid=241;ejtype=all;origin=mnet">here on MirandaNet.</a></p>
<h3>New Scholars</h3>
<p><strong>Marshal Anderson </strong><br />I have been creating digital resources, mostly for primary schools, since 1980 and I've watched a lot of things come and go. Right now I think ICT in education is a mess - but then so is education generally - with a huge number of different interests pulling it in a lot of different directions. I think we suffer from a 'because we can' attitude that can force ill-researched ideas based on whatever the latest internet buzz is to be pushed onto teachers whose heads are still spinning from the last Big Idea. I think we need to stop letting the technology define the pedagogy and look for ways ICT can support learning, rather than seeing education as a huge Lego set for ICT to try its ideas out with.</p>
<p><strong>Polis Aniftos </strong><br />I am a design and technology teacher. I have a QTS (since 1998), and I also I have two years experience in teaching physics and computers (GCE A-Levels and O-Levels). I have received my e-learning MSc in e-learning in 2007. For a few years now, I have been involved in e-learning projects with my students. Recently, I have established <a href="http://www.classcy.com">a virtual multicultural academy</a>.</p>
<p>As I have been politically active on peace making projects, the academy aims at promoting peace amongst the two communities in Cyprus and reunification of the island. Sustainable peace can only be achieved if education cultivates tolerance in coexistence and cooperation between the members of the two communities, not excluding love for sharing.</p>
<p>I have met the founder of MirandaNet in a conference here in Cyprus last year and when I heard about MirandaNet I was so surprised for the global embracement of this network.</p>
<p>I would be interested to participate in e-learning projects within this network.</p>
<p>My motto is:<br />United we stand!</p>
<p><strong>Anne Stafford</strong> <br />After a brief career in the e-learning world, I studied an Msc Information Systems. Whilst studying I taught Internet skills to disabled adults and computer skills to partially sighted or blind older people.</p>
<p>It was then that my real passion &amp; commitment to technology being accessible to all really began.</p>
<p>I was very lucky to get the opportunity to run a 3 year project when I graduated from my Masters, running a computer suite giving homeless men and women access to computers &amp; the Internet. I ran workshops in basic video making, music technology, web design - generally helping people to use computers for creativity, communication, life and learning.</p>
<p>I gained a City and Guilds 7307 adult education qualification during this time.</p>
<p>I now work for iT4Communities, a charity that gives IT professionals the opportunity to volunteer their time and skills for IT projects in the UK charitable and not-for-profit sector. And we are successfully spreading the word! With about 70 new volunteers every month adding to our community of nearly 5,500 volunteers we are an invaluable source of independent advice and guidance to thousands of charities and community groups across the UK.</p>
<p>And I still volunteer of course! I am an IT Can Help volunteer, offering disabled people help with computers and technology in their homes.</p>
<p><strong>Martin &Scaron;vanda </strong><br />I have been a teacher of English at a basic school in South Moravia Czech Republic.</p>
<p>I also study English at Masaryk University in Brno and now I have been working on my bachelor thesis. Its topic is using IWB in English language lessons. This is the reason for my joining this interesting site.</p>
<h3>New Members</h3>
<p><strong>Brian Kerslake </strong><br />An ex-teacher, I've designed software for schools and published other peoples' software since 1983. My company Topologika has had its 'ups' (BETT Awards, great comments from customers) and cyclical 'downs'. The latter are always triggered by technological changes with VLEs and SCORM being the latest sliced bread. Everyone is hoping that companies like mine will convert proven software to run on the web so it will run on VLEs; what's more, we have to tag it with a system that was designed for the US military. Many of smaller and still independent companies are finding this a challenge. Why, please, are we making life difficult? Why have we moved from (finally) stable Windows and Mac platforms to a variety of (from our early research) VLEs and SCORMs? Why are we making teachers learn a whole new skill set just as they've just about got competent with Windows? Is the industry mad or just in it for the money?</p>
