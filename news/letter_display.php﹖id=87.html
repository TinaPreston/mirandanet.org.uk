It is clear that I have met many of you  already on tour where I spoke about online professional knowledge  creation in conferences and universities in Japan, US, New Zealand,  Australia and Portugal. There are also many new members from India,  where we are working with the Podar Education Complex (<a href="http://www.podar.org/">www.podar.org</a>) on our Management of Change professional development programme (<a href="../profdev/index.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/profdev</a>)  Email me if you want more details about the iCatalyst programme. It  might suit some of our members CPD needs but has to be done as a group.</p> <p>I will get round to welcoming everyone personally as it is always a  pleasure to discuss new members&#39; vision and interests.  However, having  just returned from almost five months of travel I need more hours in the  day to catch up. You will hear from me - I promise - as soon as a space  opens up!</p> <p>I hope you all caught the discussion we have just had on MirandaLink  (one of the most important we have had so far) about the closure of  Becta (<a href="http://www.becta.org.uk/">www.becta.org.uk</a>),  the UK government agency for promoting digital technologies in schools.  If not you can log into the archive and read it there. I congratulate  MirandaNetters on the maturity of the debate and the wealth of detail  from many perspectives. I have knitted everyone&#39;s observations into an  article and will also extract a letter for the new UK coalition  government (item below: The axing of Becta).</p> <p>An international professional organisation like MirandaNet can have a  strong voice in spreading expert knowledge, demolishing myths and  raising concerns about government policies that impact on the deployment  of digital technologies in education. In the UK at the moment we have  serious concerns that the new coalition government does not fully  understand the value of digital technologies in teaching and learning. I  hope that our article will help to educate them. MirandaLink is a good  source of well-reasoned arguments for many members, who use the debates  to influence political discussions in their own back yards.</p> <p>For those who are more interested in learning theories than politics  there are two papers available in our Members&#39; only archive about the  Braided Learning model of knowledge creation that we think underpins our  MirandaLink discussions. This kind of peer debate ought to be a feature  of participation in all learning platforms in my view. Log in to the  membership pages at <a href="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/cgi-bin/members.pl">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/cgi-bin/members.pl</a>  and you will see a link to this newly created Members Archive section.</p> <p>BTW many thanks to those members who send me interesting pieces for the newsletter. Please keep them coming.</p> <p>Christina Preston</p> <h3>The axing of Becta</h3> <p>&quot;Since the news broke about closing down the British Education and  Computing Technology Agency (Becta) by the new coalition government in  the UK, MirandaNet members from all over the world have been debating  the potential effects online. A typical response came from Professor  Niki Davis, Christchurch New Zealand, &#39;I can tell you that the shock of  losing Becta is being felt worldwide - the UK is risking its reputation  as a leader in 21st century education&#39;.&quot;</p> <p>If you log into the members area here you can read the rest of  MirandaNet draft article based on our MirandaLink debate (Log in to the  membership pages at <a href="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/cgi-bin/members.pl">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/cgi-bin/members.pl</a> and you will see a link to the newly created Members Archive section). It is called <strong>Nail Varnish for Lizards?</strong>  You will have to read it to find out why. Comments will be welcome as  well as suggestions for how we can use this braided text. However,  please do not circulate beyond the membership until we have publication  agreement. I&#39;ll let you know when we have some dates.</p> <h4>Low-priority IT</h4> <p>In the meanwhile several angry members have sent items to me about  the new UK coalition&#39;s plundering of IT budgets, especially the  Harnessing Education programme, to fund the Free Schools programme. For  those who enjoy politics here are four websites to look at:</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px">Michael Gove the new Education Minister  replied to Ed Balls the opposition spokesman in the House of Commons,  &quot;We announced last week that we would recreate the standards and  diversity fund for schools, started by Tony Blair and abandoned under  his successor. We are devoting to that fund &pound;50 million saved from  low-priority IT spending-less than 1% of all capital spending allocated  for this year.&quot;</p> <p>Full details of the exchange on <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100621/debtext/100621-0004.htm#1006219000004">www.publications.parliament.uk/...#1006219000004e</a></p> <h4>Harnessing Technology funds ransacked</h4> <p>The relocated funds seem to have been expropriated from the Harnessing Technology Fund:</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px">&quot;Reallocated &pound;50 million of funding from  the Harnessing Technology Grant to create a Standards and Diversity  Fund. This will provide capital funding for Free Schools up to 31 March  2011. Funding for Free Schools will be a top priority for the Department  in the forthcoming Spending Review.&quot;</p> <p><a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/news/news/freeschools">http://www.education.gov.uk/news/news/freeschools</a></p> <h4>Harnessing Technology funds ring fenced</h4> <p>Other colleagues have point out that the Harnessing Technology Funds were once &#39;ringfenced&#39;:</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px">The Rt Hon Eric Pickles MP indicates that  in the specific revenue and capital grants for 2010/11 that Harnessing  technology is ring fenced.</p> <p><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/localgovernmentsavings">www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/localgovernmentsavings</a></p> <h4>Technology in schools: Is the clock being turned back?</h4> <p>Tony Fisher has started a mirandlink debate with this message article  about the coalition&#39;s apparent disinterest in ICT in schools. Do join  in the debate on MirandaLink if you have something to say. The article  which sparked off this debate is here:</p> <p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/10495726.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/10495726.stm</a></p> <h4>Lord Puttnam: Parliament needs to catch up with the YouTube generation</h4> <p>Let&#39;s finish this rather sad section with some good news!&nbsp;Alison  Allen sent this snippet round MirandaLink (and I urge all members who  are not receiving MirandaLink to log on and find out why - they are  missing some good debates!):</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px">&ldquo;If today&#39;s politicians truly are prepared  to take on the immense challenges of the 21st century, then as I see it  we&rsquo;ve no choice but to embrace the equally immense reach and power of  the most recent digital technologies&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;And do so in a way  that makes our present rate of adoption look exactly what it is &ndash;  half-hearted - if not pitifully inadequate!&rdquo;</p> <p>Puttnam noted that the younger generation doesn&#39;t simply rely on  accessing information, but on turning that information into new  knowledge, new products and even new resources. &ldquo;In a well run world,  you would surely expect politicians and Parliament to be helping nurture  and shape this relationship - rather than seeking to frustrate and  hinder it?,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>Worth reading in full:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.publictechnology.net/sector/central-gov/lord-puttnam-parliament-needs-catch-youtube-generation"> http://www.publictechnology.net/.../lord-puttnam-parliament-needs-catch-youtube-generation</a></p> <h3>Schools want professional development in ICT</h3> <p>Julie Nightingale from the Guardian phoned me for a comment about the  UK Guardian School Technology survey amongst teachers that highlights  support for Becta and more training for teachers in ICT. Here is an  extract:</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px">Poll results show strong support for axed  Becta, home access, and more training in technology in schools  entitlement to professional development also came top of the list of  policy issues people felt the new government should concentrate on with  some 21% voting for it above areas such as curriculum autonomy for  schools (14.1%).</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px">Christina Preston, chair of MirandaNet, an  international network of ICT in education specialists, says she is  delighted that teachers continue to value learning about ICT in teaching  and learning.</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px">However, she says many training programmes  were rather low-level and tend to be product-based. The key problem,  she says, is that teachers - and particularly headteachers and managers -  think they want training in the operation of digital technologies but  overlook the pedagogy side.</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px">&quot;There is still a limited amount of  knowledge about promoting independent and group learning that is active  and constructive,&quot; says Preston. &quot;And, of course, exams continue to  preserve the value of information transmission - even though this is the  least useful aspect of learning for most jobs - whereas the ICT skills  children need to develop are things like team-building, problem-solving,  and how to find information for themselves.&quot;</p> <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/classroom-innovation/technology-survey-becta">www.guardian.co.uk/classroom-innovation/technology-survey-becta</a></p> <h3>MirandaMod Resources</h3> <p>We now have a full range of resources collected from the last series  of MirandaMods. International MirandaNetters have been talking about a  range of subject and building collaborative maps on the subject. Many  thanks to Leon Cych, John Cuthell and Theo Keuchel who have worked hard  to make these a success. And to our sponsors, the WLE Centre, Becta,  Steljes, Oracle and Microsoft.</p> <p>This is the range of topics:</p> <ul><li>Computer games, learning and the curriculum: uneasy bedfellows? (Part 1)</li><li>Computer games, learning and the curriculum: uneasy bedfellows? (Part 2)</li><li>&#39;Mobile learning, handheld learning?&#39; What do we mean?</li><li>Balancing digital literacy with digital safety: a growing dilemma for educators</li><li>Handheld Learning</li><li>The role of communities of practice in teaching and learning</li><li>Teachers as Bloggers</li><li>ICT CPD</li><li>CPD - Critical Incidents - Lightbulb Moments</li><li>Visual Learning, Multimodal Learning</li><li>Project Learning</li><li>Projects in Mobile Learning</li><li>Visual Learning - visual distraction?</li><li>Inaugural MirandaMod (covered many topics)</li><li>We are now going to experiment with Elluminate to see whether this enhances the debates.</li></ul> <p>Look here for the details: <a href="../mirandamods/index.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/mirandamods</a></p> <p>I am writing a paper about running <strong>MirandaMods</strong> that will be ready for members soon. If you have any comments to make about them I can incorporate those. Please email me.<a href="mailto:christina@mirandanet.ac.uk"><br /></a></p> <h3>Survey request</h3> <p>The WLE Centre, who have provided us with a lot of funding in the  past, would welcome a few more replies to this survey in relation to  learning platforms. Please fill it in if you have 10 mins or so.</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px">On behalf of our &quot;VLEs 4 VET&quot; European Project partnership (<a href="http://www.vles4vet.eu/">www.vles4vet.eu</a>)  I would be grateful if you could take time to respond to our online  questionnaires at your earliest convenience. The objective is to assess  the current situation concerning the use of the Virtual Learning  Environments (VLEs) in education organisations across Europe. Our aim is  to collect good practice examples in order to prepare different  vocational organisations to implement Virtual Learning Environments.</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px">The first link below contains a  questionnaire intended for a member of teaching staff (Manager /  Principal / ICT Co-ordinator) who has an oversight of the use of VLE in  the organisation:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/VLES4VET_managers">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/VLES4VET_managers</a></li></ul> <p style="margin-left: 40px">The second link leads to a questionnaire aimed at teachers:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/VLEs4VET_teachers">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/VLEs4VET_teachers</a></li></ul> <p>Questions to Caroline Michalak: <span style="font-style: italic">carolinemichalak at fit.ie</span> +353 1 8825570</p> <h3>Interesting tidbits</h3> <h4>1) Hooked on Gadgets, and Paying a Mental Price</h4> <p>This is a disturbing report at the adult level, but I wonder what  effect the multi-gadget society will have on young minds who have  already been over stimulated by rapid scene/colour/sound changes  inherent in much of children&#39;s TV.</p> <p><strong>TECHNOLOGY | June 07, 2010 ?Your Brain on Computers: Hooked on Gadgets, and Paying a Mental Price By MATT RICHTEL</strong></p> <p>Scientists say our ability to focus is being undermined by bursts of information from e-mail and other interruptions.</p> <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/technology/07brain.html?emc=eta1">www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/technology/07brain.html?emc=eta1</a></p> <h4>2) The Digital Library 25,500+ Documents</h4> <p>EdITLib is a valuable online resource of peer-reviewed and published  international journal articles and conference papers on the latest  research, developments, and applications related to all aspects of  Educational Technology and E-Learning.</p> <p>The Digital Library enables users to:</p> <ul><li>Conduct scholarly research</li><li>Keep current on the latest research and publications in their fields</li><li>Access and fully search to publications in an easy, searchable, and efficient manner</li><li>Maintain their academic interests in the area of information technology in education</li><li>Receive Table of Contents Alerts prior to publication</li></ul> <p><a href="http://www.editlib.org/">www.EdITLib.org</a></p> <h4>3) The Risks of Parenting While Plugged in</h4> <p>An interesting article that highlights the dangers arising from  parents using online comms in preference to interaction with their  children. A future book is referenced which sounds like it might be good  reading.</p> <p><strong>Your Brain on Computers</strong>: The Risks of Parenting While Plugged In By JULIE SCELFO</p> <p>Parents&#39; use of smartphones and laptops - and its effect on their children - is becoming a source of concern to researchers.</p> <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/garden/10childtech.html?emc=eta1">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/garden/10childtech.html?emc=eta1</a></p> <h4>4) The Thinking Stick</h4> <p>Those of us who were quick enough downloaded Jeff Utecht&#39;s book,  Reach: Building Communities and Networks for Professional Development  from his Thinking Stick site before the web launch on June 15th. The  download costs &pound;4.85: the book costs &pound;33.55</p> <p><a href="http://www.thethinkingstick.com/free-book-download">http://www.thethinkingstick.com/free-book-download</a></p> <p>It is an interesting idea for selling books. Am I allowed to send you  my free .pdf version? What is the law? In principle the same as lending  you a book I think - but a fraught area. I would welcome reviews on  this book.</p> <h3>Events</h3> <h4>TeachMeet locations</h4> <p>Those of you who have participated in any of our MirandaMods over the   past few years will know Leon Cych. Leon has also been working with  TeachMeets across the country: @ianaddison and his collaborators have  put together an excellent resource that identifies locations in the UK  where  you can find like-minded professionals who are passionate about  using  ICT to enhance teaching and learning.</p> <p>Go to: <a href="http://bit.ly/teachmap">http://bit.ly/teachmap</a> for the TeachMeet Map.</p> <p>John Cuthell</p> <h4>Hand Held Learning Festival and Conference</h4> <p>Graham Brown Martin has sent a notice that the dates for the Handheld  Learning Festival &amp; Conference scheduled for this October have now  been rescheduled to January 9th -11th, 2011. Full details maybe found on  this update: <a href="http://bit.ly/a3o3JD">http://bit.ly/a3o3JD</a></p> <p>&quot;In summary, this change has been brought about in response to recent  changes in UK government that bring challenges but also opportunities.  After deep consideration we have taken the decision to establish a  larger event that brings together our most exciting disruptors,  communities and events under a single umbrella whilst keeping the  registration fee the same and extending the early bird registration that  includes the iPad until September 30th.&quot;</p> <p>Registration is at: <a href="http://bit.ly/hhl2-0">http://bit.ly/hhl2-0</a></p>
