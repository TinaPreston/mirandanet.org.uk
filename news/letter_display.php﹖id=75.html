Some of you may still be asking what a MirandaMod is. It is our name for an   informal, loosely structured <a href="../mirandamods/index.html">unconference</a>  of like-minded educators to share ideas about the use of technology to inspire   others. Drew Buddy took the word &lsquo;Mod&rsquo; from an old Scottish name   for meeting. For those who cannot attend in person or online you will find   videos, maps and blog entries to keep you in touch and giving every scholar   and Fellow a chance to air their views.</p> <p>We already have a MirandaNet website roundup about the <a href="../mirandamods/sept09_mod.htm">MirandaMod     on Communities of Practice (CoP) in September</a> led by Etienne Wenger: blogs, a video and the   collaborative map offer some key insights into what was observed by the participants. </p> <p>The next MirandaMod to be held at the <a href="../mirandamods/oct09_mod.htm">Handheld     Learning Conference</a> at the   Barbican, London on October 5th is an opportunity to stay for the whole session   or just &lsquo;drop in&rsquo; to raise issues and discuss theory and practice   about the use of ubiquitous handheld or mobile technologies in informal learning,   and the ways in which they can impact formal education. This discussion will   be continued on Tuesday December 8th at the WLE Centre, Institute of Education,   London, when Norbert Pachler, Graham Brown-Martin, John Traxler and Elizabeth   Hartnell-Young debate the characteristics of Handheld and Mobile Learning. </p> <p>Other MirandaMods at the WLE Centre, Institute of Education, London, cover   a range of subjects that members have expressed a keen interest in: 22nd October   is about balancing digital literacy with digital safety: a growing dilemma   for schools. We also have two MirandaMods about Special Needs issues on Tuesday   24th November (TBC) and Wednesday 9th December (TBC). We shall be running MirandaMods   at BETT10 and also planned for next term are MirandaMods on assessment of ICT   CPD and the value of computer games in learning. </p> <p>We have also had some interesting debates already on <a href="../fellowship/mirandalink.htm">MirandaLink</a> about   blocking sites, YouTube and one on sea safety media kicked off by Stephen Heppell.   The   new design of our website allows all members to see the messages in the archive   when you log into the <a href="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/cgi-bin/members.pl">members&rsquo; area</a> on   MirandaNet.</p> <p>Also in this edition is the review of <em><strong>Developing Professional       Practice 0 -7</strong>,</em> an exciting new publication for practitioners       engaged with babies, toddlers and children aged 0-7 by Sonia Blandford.       I&rsquo;m also reviewing members&rsquo; blogs   in each newsletter. Leon Cych&rsquo;s Learn4Life this month. </p> <p>This newsletter is another channel where members can share news and knowledge.   If you want any issues aired or any products and publications covered in the   newsletter let me know. </p> <p>Hoping to hear from you at one or other of our activities, online or face   to face,</p> <p>Yours sincerely,</p>  <p>Christina Preston<br />  	  <!-- 	  display("","christina","mirandanet.ac.uk","Contact from Newsletter") 	  // --> 	   </p> <h3><a name="b" title="b"></a>MirandaMod Round up</h3>  <p><strong><a name="b1" title="b1"></a>Etienne Wenger at the CoPs MirandaNet</strong></p>  <p>There were 28 members at the WLE centre in London and more than 30 members   logged in at different points in this <a href="../mirandamods/sept09_mod.htm">MirandaMod</a>. </p> <p>Etienne Wenger (<a href="http://www.ewenger.com">http://www.ewenger.com</a>) gave generously of his time both by   talking about the learning theories underpinning his CoP&rsquo;s concept and   by commenting on the observations of the MirandaMod participants. His first   main book refers to the interaction   between Learning, Meaning, and Identity amongst the members. A striking observation   about young learners that gave us more insight into their behaviour was the   suggestion that they are seeking multiple identities in learning today rather   than the information which used to be the goal of older learners. By the end   of the session the participants formed a consensus about the need for schools   to examine this phenomenon carefully. It also helps to explain young peoples&rsquo; fixation   with celebrities. This may not be a vacuous attraction to fame, we thought,   but an interest in one of the many identities they might present to the world. </p> <p>The video is well worth watching. It features the seminar and round table   discussion first where Ingemar Svensson talked about a CoP in Sweden, Ove Jobring   covered CoPs theories of learning and then Etienne Wenger talked about his   view of CoPs as they have developed since 1989. After that we have the MirandaMod   with members&rsquo; explaining what CoPs mean to them and Etienne Wenger commenting   on what he heard. Would Etienne have been so expressive if we had tied his   hands to his sides. We suspect not! </p> <p>We also have the collaborative map that participants collaborated on and Miles   Berry&rsquo;s presentation about open source projects as CoPs. </p> <p>Many, many thanks to our MirandaMod team: Leon Cych, Theo Kuechel, Terry Freedman   and John Cuthell. and the funders, the WLE Centre, Institute of Education,   University of London, Becta and the TDA.</p>  <p>Here are the artefacts that have emerged so far: </p> <ul> 	  <li><a href="../mirandamods/sept09_mod.htm">A record of the MirandaMod CoP event</a></li> 	  <li><a href="http://flashmeeting.e2bn.net/fm/fmm.php?pwd=9ce5e8-7245">The         archived FlashMeeting:</a></li> 	  <li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mgberry/open-source-projects-as-cop">Miles         Berry&rsquo;s presentatopm</a></li> 	  <li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/guest7c46c5b/slideshows">Katya Toneva&#39;s 	      presentaion</a></li> 	  <li><a href="http://www.l4l.co.uk/">Leon Cych&rsquo;s edited video</a></li> 	  <li><a href="https://www.mindmeister.com/maps/show/29489327">The collaborative       MindMeister map</a></li> 	</ul> <h3><a id="c" name="c" title="c"></a>MirandaMod programme 2009/2010</h3> <p><strong><a id="c1" name="c1" title="c1"></a>5.09.09 Handheld Learning: MirandaMod; Monday 5th October</strong></p> <p>If you&#39;re going to the <a href="http://www.handheldlearning2009.com/">Handheld     Learning Conference</a> for the free day on Monday,   don&#39;t forget to join us between 1100 and 1300 for the <a href="../mirandamods/oct09_mod.htm">MirandaMod</a> we&#39;re running.<br />   Participants in this MirandaMod are invited to raise issues and discuss theory   and practice about the use of ubiquitous handheld technologies in informal   learning, and the ways in which they can impact formal education. I&#39;m chairing the sessions that address these questions:</p> <ul>   <li>Can these technologies make learning for professionals, teachers and students     more personal and relevant?</li>   <li> How can we re-conceptualise assessment, so that it better reflects the     ways in which knowledge is developed collaboratively? Or should we give up     on the       nostrum of online learning?</li>   <li> What is the value of the learning experience balanced against the expense         and the risk?</li> </ul> <p> Participants at the conference can drop into this session face to face on   the first day, which is free to attend, and/or engage online for the full three     days of the conference, when participants are invited to contribute to an   online     concept map that will represent the collaborative knowledge built up by delegates     at the Handheld Learning conference, as well as their colleagues who have   participated online.</p> <p>Can&#39;t attend? Don&#39;t worry - you can contribute ideas, reflections,     examples and so on through MindMeister, the collaborative online concept   map that we&#39;re     using.</p> <p><strong>Sharing and collaborating on the map</strong></p> <p>All participants are invited to contribute to an online concept map that will     represent the collaborative knowledge built up by delegates at the Handheld     Learning conference, as well as their colleagues who have participated online.

The e-book featured details of educational projects based on Web 2.0 applications,   and has been downloaded around 11,500 times. But a year has passed and some   of the links no longer work, so it&rsquo;s time for an update. If you have   been doing anything interesting with Web 2.0, please share! So far Terry has   received just over 50 projects, plus an indication that at least one more will   be submitted a bit later in the year, when some data from the project will   be available. With this in mind, if you have recently started a great project,   but don&#39;t have much data yet, or if you missed the deadline of 30 September,   please get in touch  with Terry, who   will try to be as flexible possible.</p>  <p>The original article about this book is here: <a href="http://terry-freedman.org.uk/artman/publish/article_1565.php">Web       2.0 Projects Book</a>.       <br />   To submit your project, Terry has set up an <a href="http://www.terry-freedman.org.uk/cgi-script/csFormbuilder/forms/frmWeb20Projects.htm">online   form</a> for that purpose.   It shouldn&rsquo;t take more than a few minutes to complete, and you can submit   more than one project if you like.</p>  <p><strong><a name="d2" title="d2"></a>Web 2 Tools for Teachers</strong></p> <p>Nick Peachy has just finished a 53page booklet on Web2.0 Tools for Teachers   (aimed at language teachers).You can <a href="http://quickshout.blogspot.com/2009/09/web-20-tools-for-efl-esl-teachers.html">read   it online or download a copy</a>. There&#39;s also a recording of an online training   session which was delivered on Adobe Connect Pro and built around some of the   ideas in the booklet</p> <p><strong><a name="d3" title="d3"></a>Developing Professional Practice 0 - 7</strong> </p> <p>Developing Professional Practice 0 -7 is an exciting new publication by Professor   Sonia Blandford for practitioners engaged with babies, toddlers or children   aged 0-7 including; children&#39;s centre leaders and staff, foster carers, nursery   carers and managers, children&#39;s trusts, social workers, support teachers, teachers,   teacher trainers, child care students and tutors, policy makers and parents. </p> <p>Details can be found on: <a href="http://www.pearsoned.co.uk/dpp">www.pearsoned.co.uk/dpp</a> </p> <h3><a name="e" title="e"></a>Digital resources</h3> <p><strong><a name="e1" title="e1"></a>A free mapping tool: South Beach</strong></p>  <p>Chris Yapp came across a free mapping tool on the web a few months ago, which   he thinks might interest a number of people within MirandaNet. It is in early   development but is a very flexible tool for the visualisation of knowledge   and situations seeking improvement. Chris has been speaking to its author and   found that it is already being used by school children for problem solving   but also in organisations for strategic decision making among other applications.</p> <p>The tool is called Southbeach and it can be downloaded onto a windows platform   from <a href="http://www.southbeachinc.com/">www.southbeachinc.com</a>.   You can find more of Chris&rsquo;s observations on this URL. </p> <h3><a name="f" title="f"></a>Blogspot</h3> <p><strong><a name="f1" title="f1"></a>Leon Cych: Learn4Life</strong></p> <p><a href="http://www.l4l.co.uk/">http://www.l4l.co.uk</a></p>  <p>Leon is one of the leading bloggers who uses video to capture events he is   commenting on. His quick turn round on MirandaMod videos is much respected.   I interviewed Leon for his views of blogging that he began in 1994- the same   year as MirandaNet developed a website: </p> <p>&ldquo;I see my role as finding and disseminating new innovative practice   in education. I do this mainly through video blogging at the moment. My blog   is a lifelong research project into learning - it documents and reflects on   learning in the UK and beyond. I began blogging way back in 1994 ...although   it wasn&#39;t called that then. I use the blog to show the progress of innovation   in education ICT and the possibilities for the future. I&#39;m never tempted to   stop because it is a lifelong concern - I will never stop blogging until the   day I die. The best way to search my blog is by the key words listed in the   sidebar - you should find plenty of content there - be warned there are thousands   of hours of video - these films are all archived at <a href="http://www.archive.org/">http://www.archive.org</a>  as   well and are all made available under a Creative Commons licence and are free   for anyone to download or embed as they wish. An attribution would be   nice but not really mandatory.</p> <p> &ldquo;If people could read one post I&#39;d recommend   my latest one at : <a href="http://www.l4l.co.uk/?p=835">http://www.l4l.co.uk/?p=835</a> which   has had over a 1000 views in the last few days - I consider it to be my best   film - shot and edited in   under 12 hours from the event happening to being uploaded to the web. I can   work faster and more intimately with classes than bigger organisations like   the BBC or Teachers&#39; TV because I have a wealth of contacts and I understand   the classroom having had 25 years experience of teaching. I try to film children   in as natural and authentic setting as possible and will give the class a talk   beforehand about the technology I am going to use and what will happen during   filming - they often forget I&#39;m there. This rapid turn-around helps speed up   the dissemination of best practice in this area and provides a dynamic record   of the progress of technology in education that&#39;s current and vital. </p> <p>&ldquo;If people   are thinking of blogging I would recommend that they think very carefully about   their audience and how they wish to engage with them. Start small and don&#39;t   be afraid of making mistakes. I would recommend using <a href="http://posterous.com/"><strong>Posterous.com</strong></a> as   it is easy and simple and you can upload blogposts by mailing them to the site.   I   think blogs are wonderful for reflection and community building I doubt they   will be overtaken anytime soon by other forms of media. There are so many blogs   I could recommend, some of the best are those by </p> <ul>   <li>Theo Kuechel - Digital Signposts     (<a href="http://theok.typepad.com/">http://theok.typepad.com</a>)</li>   <li>Tom Barrett&#39;s     Blog (<a href="http://tbarrett.edublogs.org/">http://tbarrett.edublogs.org</a>)</li>   <li>Jose Picardo&#39;s Box     of Tricks (<a href="http://www.boxoftricks.net/">http://www.boxoftricks.net</a>)</li>   <li>Ollie Bray&#39;s blog (<a href="http://olliebray.com/">http://olliebray.com</a>)</li>   <li>and     for the more technically minded - Tony Hirst&#39;s OUseful Blog (<a href="http://ouseful.wordpress.com/">http://ouseful.wordpress.com</a>)</li> </ul> <p>&ldquo;but     there are literally hundreds I could list.&rdquo;</p> <p>I&rsquo;d like to publish the views of more bloggers.
