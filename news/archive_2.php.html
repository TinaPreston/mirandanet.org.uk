    <h2 id="research">MirandaNet Research published</h2>
    <p>The Centre of Work-based Learning for Professionals(WLE) has published
      new work-based research from teachers into how concept or mind mapping
      can be used to support teaching and learning. This collection of papers,
      developed in MirandaNet Fellowship working groups, is aimed at teachers
      and others in education who are new to the concept of hand-drawn or digital
      mapping that includes sound, graphics and animation, collectively called
      multimodal mapping. Topics covered include how digital mind maps can be
      used to help AS students to recognise how different parts of the ICT syllabus
      link together, rather than dealing with each topic in isolation; and how
      primary children can use digital maps to organise their thinking in project
      work. </p>
    <p>The research results, published in the WLE e-journal Reflecting Education,
      include podcasts as well as written papers. These papers by teachers working
      in schools are accompanied by contributions from internationally renowned
      academic thinkers who present aspects of their theories that are most relevant
      to practitioners.</p>
    <p>The inclusion of studies which draw on teachers&#8217; experiences in
      class alongside the writing of key theorists is a break with journal convention,
      but could point the way forward for the future, says Christina Preston
      of ICT thinktank, MirandaNet, who co-edited this volume of papers.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Unlike most journals, Reflecting Education relates academic quality
      standards to a professional audience. The papers aim to introduce the people
      actually working in schools to learning theory whilst still keeping it
      relevant to classroom reality. Now that all teachers are to be obliged
      to take Masters level qualifications this kind of work-based research is
      likely to be increasingly appropriate.&#8221; </p>

    <h2 id="tag">MirandaNet Evaluation of TAG MAPS</h2>
    <p>This evaluation has been produced by MirandaNet for TAGLearning. The aim
      of the evaluation was to gauge the views of teacher and pupil users of
      its MAPS software, and the ways in which it has impacted on their teaching,
      learning and work management.</p>
    <p>This research collected data from the MAPS user base provided by TAG Learning
      to investigate the perceptions of teachers and students of the impact of
      MAPS on learning, teaching and workflow.</p>
    <p>Data was collected through email contact, online questionnaires and telephone
      interviews.</p>
    <p>The Evaluation is located in the <a href="../casestudies/232.html">Teachers
        as Researchers E-Journal</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="guardian">Guardian Report on the CPD experiences of ICT Advisers</h2>
    <p>The latest research by MirandaNet Fellows, <strong>Braided Learning</strong>,
      is about how an e-mature community of practice is learning online. There
      is a report on the Guardian website:</p>
    <p><strong>Nightingale, J. Research : Education without complications, Guardian,
        Link Supplement June 19th, London</strong> <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/elearning/story/0,,2105790,00.html">http://education.guardian.co.uk/elearning/story/0,,2105790,00.html</a></p>
    <p>It has been a busy time at MirandaNet. They have produced another report,
      funded by the Institute of Education's centre for excellence in work-based
      learning (WLE), investigating teachers'. advisers' and teacher educators'
      professional development needs in ICT with 250 members of the IT specialist
      groups Naace, ITTE and MirandaNet.</p>
    <p>It found that around a third of the respondents had received no ICT training
      for three years and some ten per cent had never had any form of formal
      instruction. Practice-based training, rather than skills-based or academic
      courses, were deemed most useful by 41%. In terms of motives for using
      ICT, equipping learners to be independent featured prominently (48%) as
      did international collaborations (19%). Very few respondents made any link
      to supporting vocational learning &shy; a key strand of the new 14-19 curriculum.</p>
    <p>In terms of ICT CPD needed for the future, there was a split in opinion
      with Naace members identifying learning platforms as the priority while
      ITTE and MirandaNet members pinpointed a need for practice-based courses
      and applied research. </p>

  Child Development and Computers</h2>
    <p>MirandaNet Fellow <a href="../fellowship/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=69.html">Mechelle De
        Craene</a> has been experimenting with the use of video to capture moments
        in a child's learning that cannot be captured in any other way. The video
        extract to the right is hosted on You Tube. Most MirandaNet visitors
        will not be familiar with the kind of learning problems that face Mechelle's
        pupils, and will be surprised to learn that this is a video of a student
        learning to use the computer for the first time. In particular he is &quot;learning
        to make the connection between the mouse and the actions on the screen
        as well as digital object permanence (i.e. to look for objects or images
        on a screen even though they may appear to be hiding).&quot; Mechelle
        says she is very proud of him. &quot;He is such a joy to teach.&quot; </p>
    <p>When viewing this video, look out for the moment when the boy realises

  <p><strong>MirandaNet</strong> and <strong>Promethean World</strong> are pleased 
    to announce a <a href="../associates/promethean_iwb.htm">joint research project 
    into the use of Interactive White Boards</a>. The <a href="../associates/promethean_iwb.htm"><strong>ACTIVWorld 
    Project</strong></a> builds on earlier work supported by Promethean World, 
    which is reported in detail on the <a href="../associates/interactive.htm">Interactive 
    Whiteboard Project</a> page. There is more information about this project 
    on the <a href="http://www.mirandanorth.org.uk/">MirandaNorth</a> page, where 
    there is a link to John Cuthell's <a href="http://www.virtuallearning.org.uk/whiteboards/index.html">Virtual 
    Learning</a> website and further details of the findings. Visitors can explore 
    parts of the <a href="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/cgi-bin/journals/search_ej.pl?ejtype=prm"><strong>Promethean 
    Ambassadors E-Journal</strong></a> as well.</p>
  <p>Our interactive <a href="../ejournal/index.html">Ejournals</a> have produced a growing 
    number of <a href="../ejournal/casestudies.htm">Case Studies</a> which you can 
    explore.</p>
  <p>MirandaNet have published research projects which highlight what kind of 
    ICT CPD works. There are <strong>three</strong> key areas of publications:</p>
  <p>The <strong>first</strong> is <a href="../tta/index.html">Learning to use ICT in classrooms: 
    teachers&#8217; and trainers&#8217; perspectives</a> (<strong>Preston, C</strong> 
    2004 TTA/MirandaNet London) . This reports an investigation into the effectiveness 
    of the NOF programme for training UK teachers in the use of ICT in teaching 
    and learning (<a href="../tta/index.html">follow this link for more information</a>).</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="../ftp/part1a.pdf">Part 
      One</a></strong>: A summary of the evaluation of English NOF ICT teacher 
      training programme 1999 - 2003 (<a href="../ftp/part1a.pdf">PDF 
      file, 220K</a>)</li>
    <li><strong><a href="../ftp/part2a.pdf">Part 
      Two</a></strong>: Emergent trends from the evaluation of the NOF ICT programme 
      for school trainers, ICT advisers and teacher educators. (<a href="../ftp/part2a.pdf">PDF 
      file, 672K</a>)</li>
    <li><strong><a href="../ftp/part3a.pdf">Part 
      Three</a></strong>: The full evaluation of the English NOF ICT teacher training 
      programme (1999 - 2003) (<a href="../ftp/part3a.pdf">PDF 
      file, 1MB</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>NB</strong>: to read these files you will need a PDF reader such 
    as <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html"><strong>Acrobat</strong></a> 
    <img src="../images/reader_icon.gif" alt="Acrobat Reader" title="Acrobat Reader" width="25" height="20">.</p>
  <p>The <strong>second</strong> arises from a collaboration with <a href="../research/international_research.htm"><strong>Southampton 
    University</strong></a>. See the reports on <a href="../associates/supplyteachers.htm">Supply 
    Teachers</a>, undertaken in collaboration with Select Education (Preston and 
    Danby 2005), and in <a href="../associates/astonswann.htm">ECDL for Educators</a>, 
    in collaboration with <a href="../associates/astonswann.htm"><strong>Aston-Swann</strong></a> 
    (Preston and Danby 2005). </p>
  <p>And a <strong>third</strong> report from 2000 which is still relevant to 
    building communities of practice as an ICT CPD model is <a href="../ftp/cox_summ_forw.pdf">Teachers 
    as Innovators: an evaluation of what motivates teachers to use ICT</a> (Preston, 
    Cox and Cox 2004 TTA/MirandaNet London) (summary only: <a href="../ftp/cox_summ_forw.pdf">PDF 
    file, 120K</a>)</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://wec.mirandanet.org.uk/">World Ecitizens web site</a> 
    and <a href="https://wec.mirandanet.org.uk/elapa.htm">E-Lapa</a> 
    Projects feature work with pupils, some of which can be viewed in the <a href="https://wec.mirandanet.org.uk/gallery/">World 
    Ecitizens Gallery</a>, and in the <a href="https://wec.mirandanet.org.uk/gallery/elapa.htm">E-Lapa 
    Gallery</a>. Members might want to explore the <a href="../worldecitizens/wejournal.htm">WE 
    Journal</a> as well.</p>
  <p>We have three slightly <a href="../fellowship/current_projects.htm">older Projects</a> 
    which should be of interest to all our members. Have a look at the <a href="../webclassroom/intro.htm">Web@Classroom</a> 
    Project, an exciting international project involving colleagues in Ireland, 
    Portugal, Spain and the UK. We publish some of the early results, and there 
    are lots of pictures of the pupils in an English school.</p>
