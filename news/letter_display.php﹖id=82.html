<p><strong>MirandaNet Newsletter February 2010</strong></p>
<h2>Round up of new members in February 2010</h2>
<h3>Do we need a new vision?</h3>
<p>We've had many new scholars joining this year already who must have  seen our tag line: sharing experience and expertise. There seems to be a  growing enthusiasm for information collaboratively learning  internationally. In this context Is our vision statement still current?  Let me know if you have some new thoughts about it. You will find if on our front page:</p>
<p><em>The MirandaNet Fellowship, founded in 1992, is an e-community of  practice for international ICT policy makers, teachers, teacher  educators, researchers and commercial developers who are passionate  about digital technology in teaching and learning and about using  technologies to promote cultural understanding and democratic  participation. Currently there are over 600 members in over 50 countries  worldwide. The website, online forums, seminars, workshops and projects  run by members are funded by international partner companies and  government agencies. MirandaNet gratefully acknowledges the support of  its company partners.</em></p>
<h3>New members</h3>
<p>Becta, the UK government agency has called us &lsquo;The FaceBook of ICT  education'. What is so pleasing is the growing number of international  members we now have. However, I still think the UK is still too strongly  represented in our MirandaLink debates and would like far more input  from our colleagues abroad. And I think we are more than a social  networking site because we are sharing and creating new professional  knowledge in areas where no one yet knows the answers. You can find some  of our papers about our theory of braided learning on here: <a href="../publications/index.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/publications</a></p>
<p>Despite our efforts it is so hard for many teachers all over the  world to gain a full understanding of the value of digital technologies  in classrooms either because the right kind of programmes are not  available or because they cannot get support cover to pay for someone to  stand in. UNESCO has called us the Robin Hood of professional  development in digital technologies. This is because we find funders who  will fund programmes in order to stimulate case study material - or we  invite teachers to work on our research projects as co-researchers. Our  latest research indicates that a small group of teachers are now seeing  the best route forward for them is informal learning like Twitter,  MirandaMods and TeachMeets. We are working on a new series of programmes  at the moment that focuses on these technologies and setting up  projects in your school - you can find out more here: <a href="../profdev/index.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/profdev</a></p>
<p>All our new members prove that there are many different kinds of  professional educators who want to learn from each other. Our new  tranche of members shows how widely teachers internationally are seeing  the power of informal learning. For example, following Sameer Toor's  membership in February we have just had nine more new members from the  Beaconschool Systems in Pakistan. These teachers say they want to be  part of a wider community and are most welcome to MirandaNet. A group  like this can write a collaborative article about their practice to gain  their Fellowship.</p>
<p>But email addresses and profiles do not always tell me which country  our members come from. Nevertheless, MirandaNet has a very broad  professional base that represents the many people who are now involved  in learning about and teaching about digital technologies: teachers,  teachers of teachers and researchers. In this group of new scholars we  have lecturers, independent consultants, government policy makers, and  senior managers. Hardip Mothada, for example, who has been in industry,  is now an ICT teacher and assistant head in London. He was already  designing computer games at 15 years old and is now interested in  finding some engaging action research topics.</p>
<p>You will find summarised profiles here but more on the web. Do get in  touch directly if you see a new member who shares your interests or who  may be able to help you.</p>
<h3>New Fellowship</h3>
<p>I hope all our scholars are at least working out how they can share  their knowledge in a contribution to our e-journals which makes you a  Fellow. Keith Heggart is a new scholar who has already taken the plunge  and sent an article about his new project. We will be celebrating his  achievement in our next newsletter. Well done Keith. We see each  contribution to our e-journals as a contribution to the knowledge  creation we promote.</p>
<p><strong>Keith Heggart</strong><a href="mailto:admin@education4u.com.au"></a></p>
<p>I became a teacher via a round-about route, including careers in the  Australian Defence Force and a venture building and hosting websites  when such things were still considered out of the ordinary. Although I  stumbled into teaching, I quickly found that I wanted to make a career  out of it, motivated and inspired in equal measure by the enthusiasm  that students bring to their lives and their work.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to spend a sizeable part of my career at schools  that have had 1:1 laptop programs, and so I've been immersed in the  frustrations and possibilities of ICT and education from the start. One  of the highlights of my career was seeing an autistic boy present to his  classmates his stop-motion film - a product that would never have been  possible without the use of technology. This is one of the key features  of technology, I believe - the capacity to communicate with more people,  more effectively.</p>
<p>Recently, I have become an Apple Distinguished Educator, and I've  become especially interested in the uses of hand held technologies in  learning. I've enjoyed developing apps for the iPhone, and I'm trialling  using iPhones in an educational setting at the moment, with a number of  Vocational Education students. It's very exciting, and I hope to share  the findings soon.</p>

<h3>New Scholars</h3>
<p><strong>David Beere</strong><a href="mailto:david.beere@macegroup.com"></a></p>
<p>I have worked in the Education sector providing ICT Consultancy for a  number of BSF and Academy projects since 2007 and am very keen to  ensure that money invested in ICT in schools is spent wisely and for  best educational impact.</p>
<p>I am a firm believer in the "right" technology for the job in hand  rather than just putting in the latest gadgets, and see ICT as a way of  enabling teachers to deliver their content in a more dynamic and  engaging way.</p>
<p><strong>Paula Bernaschina</strong><a href="mailto:p.bernaschina@mdx.ac.uk"></a></p>
<p>I am a Senior Lecturer in English for Academic Purposes at Middlesex  University and provide academic support to undergraduates and  postgraduates in the School of Engineering and Information Sciences. My  professional/research interests include technology and language  learning, peer tutoring and the writing process and writing in the  disciplines. In 2001 I co-authored <em>Get on board: A computer guide for ESL students</em>. I am interested in using Web 2.0 for distance and work based learning in addition to my campus-based teaching.</p>
<p><strong>Trevor Gaunt</strong><a href="mailto:t100@ezeedsl.co.uk"></a></p>
<p>I am interested in the  direction of 'web 2' technology and how  teaching and learning will eventually  marry technology to student  centred study. I came across MirandaNet researching  an essay on the use  of video-conferencing to support small group study which has   stimulated an interest in following the broader agenda and discussion.  Hence my  reason for joining the MirandaNet is initially to observe and  follow the  developments until such time as I have my own contributions  to share.</p>
<p><strong>Hardip Mothada</strong><a href="mailto:hmothada@actonhigh.ealing.sch.uk"></a></p>
<p>I am an ICT Teacher and Assistant Headteacher at an inner London  Secondary school. I have been an ICT co-ordinator and Head of ICT in  previous schools. Prior to working in education I worked as a programmer  and hardware engineer in various companies in the multimedia,  networking and music industry sectors. My educational background is  Engineering (undergraduate level) and Music Technology (Masters).</p>
<p>As a very young man I was on the receiving end of Secondary ICT  Education in the 1980's, having been in the first cohort to take O Level  Computing at my school. I was successful in having three microcomputer  games published between the ages of 15 and 17.</p>
<p>My interest in joining MirandaNet is to explore areas for research,  and to ultimately establish my own area for some fruitful practice based  research. The areas I am particularly interested in are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective teaching methodologies for ICT as a subject distinct from "traditional" subjects</li>
<li>Game based learning</li>
<li>Mobile technologies</li>
<li>Programming as part of the ICT Curriculum</li>
<li>Engaging non-musicians with Music Technology</li>
<li>Understanding learning at the cognitive level</li>
</ul>
<p>I am optimistic about and energised by the potential for the positive societal impact of ICT.</p>
<p><strong>Elaine Reddy</strong><a href="mailto:elainereddy@hotmail.com"></a></p>
<p>I have been training teachers for the post 16 sector for two decades  but in the last two years I have been using software to deliver and  assess whole programmes now. My ambition is to be able to find ways to  qualify staff to teach using a methodology that enables them to study in  a way that compliments the transition from work to teaching and is a  support system not a burden. My colleagues and I use Moodles, webinars  and as much Open Source software as we can to offer an variety of media.  Our biggest technological problem is watching teaching - we are using  live streaming but need to find out more. If anyone else is working on  anything like this I would love to collaborate.</p>
<p><strong>Gaynor Sharp</strong><a href="mailto:gaynor.sharp@becta.org.uk"></a></p>
<p>Research Manager, Becta<strong><br /> </strong>Gaynor works primarily managing qualitative research projects.  She has recently published research that focused on parents' engagement  with their children's learning involving technologies and the impact of  this in their family learning experiences. It also explores  parental/school communication using technology. The research report and  literature review can be found here: <a href="http://partners.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=rh&amp;catcode=_re_mr_02&amp;rid=17152">http://partners.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=rh&amp;catcode=_re_mr_02&amp;rid=17152</a>.</p>
<p>She has also managed a Narrowing the Gap project for low and  underachieving learners and has worked with a media company preparing  interactive teacher videos and other media (podcasts and learner  videos). A NTG literature review can be found at: <a href="http://partners.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=rh&amp;catcode=_re_rp_02&amp;rid=17003">http://partners.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=rh&amp;catcode=_re_rp_02&amp;rid=17003</a> and the research report is here: <a href="http://partners.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=rh&amp;catcode=_re_vi_ng_03&amp;rid=17439">http://partners.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=rh&amp;catcode=_re_vi_ng_03&amp;rid=17439</a>.</p>
<p>Her involvement in these project stems from her own interests in the  learning process. She taught school science for about 12 years in a  number of schools in the Midlands. In 2004, Gaynor completed her  doctoral thesis on pupil's attitudes to secondary school science  experiences, whilst lecturing in biomolecular science at Coventry  University and on the secondary science PGCE with the Open University.  Gaynor has worked as a research manager with Becta for five years and  managed the Using Digital Creativity to engage and motivate hard to  reach pupils in BESD schools project in 2007.</p>

<p><strong>Sameer Toor</strong><a href="mailto:sameertoor@hotmail.com"></a></p>
<p>I am a Regional Coordinator for ET/ICT for the Beaconhouse School  System, and also a programme Leader for the CIE's Diploma in Teaching  with ICT. My special interest is in supporting and managing CPD of  teachers.</p>
<p><strong>Crispin Weston</strong><a href="mailto:crispin.weston@alphalearning.co.uk"></a></p>
<p>I am founder and Chairman of SALTIS (Suppliers Association for  Learning Technology and Interoperability in Schools), which has over 100  industry members and is working to improve interoperability standards  for educational technology, particularly between VLEs and learning  content. If learning technology can "plug and play" then teachers will  be able easily to buy what makes a difference for them in the classroom  and drive a market in innovative technology. We believe that such an  approach should replace current, prescriptive models for the  implementation of ICT in schools. My background, before getting into  standards work, was in developing a VLE and, before that, teaching  History. I live in Dorset and enjoy sailing, backpacking and playing  real tennis rather badly.</p>
