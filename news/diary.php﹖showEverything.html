<p>This is our 17th <em>What the Research Says</em> event. MOOCs are still very much the new kid on the block and are 'riding high the new wave' of education. Or are they? In this event we will be looking at what makes for a good MOOC design. What works well and why, and what doesn't work well and why? What are we learning when delivering or studying via large scale access to online learning experiences and how can the community for online learning design benefit? What is the thinking of designing online learning, both for formal and informal experiences? What is the critical thinking behind designing such experiences? What can help us think about the learning experience for<br />students?<br /> <br />You will hear some initial results and evaluations and ideas from those who have delivered and are delivering learning experiences using open online learning context.</p><hr />
<p><strong>Starts 30th October 2014</strong></p><h2><strong>Third International Learning Design Challenge: Move-It-Online</strong></h2><p>Please join us for our Third International Learning Design Challenge: Move-It-Online<br /> <br /> Led by Professor Diana Laurillard from The London Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education in collaboration with Building Community Knowledge, MirandaNet, Creative Digital Solutions and Hands-ON ICT project.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Aim<br /> </strong><br /> Our 3rd online International Learning Design Challenge is about understanding the impact of taking teaching and learning activities online. We will provide ways of describing and planning effective teaching ideas, especially those that illustrate ‘pedagogically purposeful uses of technology for learning’. The Challenge is to transfer this to your own optimal way to move it online.<br /> To sign up and find out more</p>

<p><strong>26 September at the Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education 2014</strong></p><h2><strong>What the Research Says Event: The Potential and Impact of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) </strong></h2><p>MirandaNet is collaborating and supporting this event at the London Knowledge Lab on 26 September 2014 that follows up on a series that began in 2012 based on a short discussion document titled “Technology can help us learn faster, better, deeper …” So, where are we now in 2014? Perhaps there are more questions than answers but evidence is emerging showing us where the <em>right kind of context </em>of use of technology does illustrate impact on learning. But what is <em>the right kind of context of use</em>? Can this knowledge be shared?</p>
<p>If you cannot come to this event at LKL join us online as part of our MirandaNet Mod series for a "What the Research Says Event" for The Potential and Impact of TEL on Teaching and Learning.</p>
<p><strong>Started on 26 September, comments still open</strong><br /><br /><a href="https://sas.elluminate.com/m.jnlp?sid=2007016&amp;password=M.7D9625102F69D5E22B59FE601A39D3">https://sas.elluminate.com/m.jnlp?sid=2007016&amp;password=M.7D9625102F69D5E22B59FE601A39D3</a></p>

<p>Details of the presenters are available at:<br /><a href="https://www.lkldev.ioe.ac.uk/lklinnovation/the-potential-and-impact-of-tel-on-teaching-and-learning/">https://www.lkldev.ioe.ac.uk/lklinnovation/the-potential-and-impact-of-tel-on-teaching-and-learning/</a></p>
<p>This what the research event explores, discusses and debates: how can teachers use old and new learning technology to drive learning innovation and discover what works and why? What is the potential and impact of technology on teaching and learning experience? What is the evidence that pedagogies using technology help us learn any better?  What are students’ expectations of learning through technology? How might we facilitate students to reflect on the role of technology when learning?</p>
<p>MirandaNet will be debating the research they have done with  IRIS Connect, LightSpeed and Groupcall in particular who will demonstrate their products along with BrainPop, Tablet Academy and EU Handson ICT.</p>
<p>The event will include more presentations, demos and discussions to exchange experiences of the challenges faced in education, and to test how well and where technology help teachers to discover and create innovative learning experiences. And what is the view of the students? Are they equipped to get the best out of this kind of learning?</p>
<p>What does the evidence tell us about the types of teaching and learning taking place?</p>
<p>What is “it” that makes a difference to classroom and online teaching learning?</p>
<p>What are students’ learning expectations from digital technology? What are teachers’ learning expectations of digital technology?</p>

The digital era has produced new forms and contexts, from Youtube to machinima. Multimodal analysis offers ways to account for all the modes in play in a given form or text, and the ways in which they work together, moving beyond conventional forms of film and television analysis which privilege filming and editing. This seminar will be of interest to students, educators, researchers and academics working with film, television and animation.<br />Contributors: Andrew Burn (IOE), Theo van Leeuwen (University of Southern Denmark), John Potter (IOE), Mark Reid (British Film Institute)</p>

<p><strong>PUBLIC LECTURE June 4th, 5.30 pm, London Knowledge Lab</strong></p><h2><strong>In the code kitchen: Meaning-making and multimodality in a 'learn to code' curriculum</strong></h2><p>PUBLIC LECTURE June 4th, 5.30 pm, London Knowledge Lab<br />In the code kitchen: Meaning-making and multimodality in a 'learn to code' curriculum<br />Dr Marion Walton, University of Cape Town<br />Schools around the world are under pressure to replace or supplement computer literacy classes with computer programming or 'coding'. At universities, even would-be journalists are admonished to "learn to code" if they want employment in a dismal job market. Given the importance of visual languages and media in coding curricula, there is surprisingly little research on what coding means for multimodal theory.<br />This may be because coding is like cooking. Most of the action happens in the gap between ingredients and cooked meal, and the process remains obscure to those who only see the end product. Understanding the role of multimodality in learning to code requires a look beyond the finished digital artefact. We need to make sense of the relationship between source code, software and the internal seams of digital media.<br />I present a low cost media literacy coding curriculum presented collaboratively with Bhavana Harrilal. We emphasised tangible programming, web-making, visual design, FOSS development processes, mobile compatibility and game design and development. This approach proved valuable not only for the design and production of a browser game but for the insights it provided into the representational and conceptual processes at work as young people took on apprentice roles as programmers and digital designers in our coding kitchen.<br />The event is free, but tickets need to be booked via the MODE website - http://store.ioe.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&amp;modid=2&amp;deptid=161&amp;catid=35&amp;prodid=290 - or contact Rob Mitchell – r.mitchell@ioe.ac.uk</p><hr />
<p><strong>Course starting on 19 May 2014</strong></p><h2><strong>Brush up your skills in learning design</strong></h2><p>MirandaNet is a partner in an EU project called HandsOn ICT with colleagues in Greece, Spain, Slovenia and The Netherlands. We learnt much from the first pilot and are keen to invite interested colleagues to the second pilot that starts on 19th May- Hope to see you online...Invitation follows...<br /> <br /> <strong>We are looking for educators to participate in a free, open and online course (MOOC) that will help you reign your Learning with ICTs and Creativity <br /> </strong><br /> In the context of the HANDSON project we are offering a course for teachers in Higher Education, Vocational Education Training and Secondary Schools. It is a 5-weeks MOOC about Designing Learning with the use of digital tools and creativity techniques.<br /> The features of the course are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An emphasis on collaborative working in small groups bringing together educators with wide and diverse backgrounds from around the world;</li>
<li>A focus on the Learning Design Studio (LDS) approach, a design process to help educators design courses and learning activities.</li>
<li>Facilitators with expertise in Online Learning, Creativity and the Learning Design Studio who will work with the pilot teachers to explore the potential of this learning method to introduce ICT in the teaching and learning processes.</li>
<li>The opportunity to observe, practice and learn about methods for peer review and peer mentoring.</li>
<li>The creation of practical artefacts that can be reused by the participants in their actual classrooms.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /> The main language of the course will be English: the learning materials and the communication with the facilitators will be in English. However teamwork can happen in any other language.  <br /> <strong>Start Date:</strong> 19/05/2014<br /> <strong>End Date:</strong> 20/06/2014<br /> <strong>Duration:</strong> 5 weeks<br /> <strong>Expected dedication time: </strong>2 to 6 hours / week<br /> <strong>Educators who join </strong>this second pilot are not expected to have any particular expertise in online learning. We are looking for educators or teacher trainers from secondary education, vocational education or higher education. <br /> <strong>How to join this course: Go to </strong><a href="http://riga.uoc.es/moodle/">http://riga.uoc.es/moodle/</a> and register to the Design Studio course. <br /> <br /> More information on: <a href="http://handsonict.eu/">http://handsonict.eu</a><br /> <br /> <strong>Notes about the HANDSON project and environment<br /> </strong>The Hands-On ICT is a project funded by the Lifelong Learning Programme. The project team has been exploring the value of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) and Community Online Open Courses (COOCs) for the continuous professional development of educators. The aim is to create a holistic environment that provides teachers from higher education, vocational education and schools with everything they need to learn about making the right choice of digital tools for a given pedagogical activity. <br /> <br /> You will find all this information here as well<br /> <a href="../researchexchange/events-2/eu-handson/index.html">http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/researchexchange/events-2/eu-handson/</a></p><hr />

<li>Monday 25th March: Brisbane, Australia</li>
<li>Wednesday 27th March: University of Canterbury, Christchurch,<br />New Zealand</li>
</ol>
<p>Each session will comprise three separate workshops as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Workshop One: Opportunities for new academic practice using the EdComms environment</strong> (<a href="http://www.educationcommunities.org/">www.educationcommunities.org</a>)*</p>
<p>For all staff: one hour</p>
<p>This workshop will focus on how academics are using online communities of practice environments to improve the significance and impact of their research. In the UK assessment of the quality of academic research to be carried out in 2013, new criteria have been introduced which relate to impact and reach of the research. *UK Research Excellence Framework Criteria for the 2013 research assessment exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Workshop Two: MESH Mapping Educational Specialist knowHow - Ensuring school teaching is an evidence based profession</strong></p>
<p>For education professionals: one hour</p>
<p>Ensuring school teaching is an evidence based profession - meeting the OECD challenge for effective knowledge management in school-based education.This workshop will focus on new ways of working and opportunities for international collaboration through MESH - The Mapping Educational Specialist knowHow project (<a href="http://www.meshguides.org/">www.meshguides.org</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Workshop Three: Join the Translational Research Community - experience writing a MESH map of your research or research you know of which needs translating into practice</strong></p>
<p>For education professionals: one hour</p>
<p>Translating academic research reports into MESHGuides for learners, teachers, trainee teachers and policy makers can be relatively quick for those who have their research at their fingertips. At the end of this workshop, you will have the top level structure for a MESHGuide in a specialist area. Groups of educators wishing to work on an area of common interest are welcome. If you don&rsquo;t have research of your own, then if you bring a major research<br />report which has influenced you you will be able to turn it in to a MESHGuide.</p>
<p>We welcome developers of MESHGuides which focus on threshold or troublesome concepts, on areas which give learners most difficulty and on areas which are most likely to make a difference to student attainment.</p>

<p>Chinese characters used purely for their sound values are attested in the Chun Qiu 春秋 and Zhan Guo 戰國 manuscripts, in which zhi 氏 was used to write shi 是 and vice versa, just lines apart; the same happened with shao 勺 for Zhao 趙, with the characters in question being homophonous or nearly homophonous at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Making Your Research Count - using  Web 2.0: the Education Communities platform</strong></p>
<p>Dr Marilyn Leask, Professor of Educational Knowledge Management, and Dr Christina Preston, Professor of Educational Innovation, University of Bedfordshire</p>
<p>Pilot research (2010-2012) involving nearly a thousand academics and their partners from over 100 institutions in more than 20 countries has developed and evaluated the use of Web 2.0 tools for research communities using EdComms. This seminar will explore the needs of research communities for online interaction, the opportunities provided by platforms like EdComms and the ongoing challenges. Examples which emerged from the pilot are:</p>
<ul>
<li>project management for research projects which include partners from other institutions</li>
<li>collaborating with others on writing books and reports</li>
<li>managing bid writing with a group of national and international colleagues</li>
<li>networking with research users to increase impact of research</li>
<li>networking with students once they graduate</li>
<li>to support working and special interest groups within professional associations</li>
<li>building a community of enquiry around a topic</li>
<li>creating a community to keep in touch with people with similar interests who have come together at a conference so that they can continue to work together</li>
<li>working online with people outside the organisation &ndash; employers, work placement staff, experts</li>
</ul>
<p>King's has subscribed to the EdComms Web 2.0 platform (<a href="http://www.educationcommunities.org">www.educationcommunities.org</a>). All King's staff are also invited to a workshop / demonstration of the software 13.00-14.00 or 1500-15.45 Room B6 Wednesday October 24 October. Bring your laptop.</p>

<p><strong>12 - 13 March 2008</strong></p><h2><strong>What Works Where?</strong></h2><p>ICT CPD programmes as a focus for change <br /> in theory, policy and practice:<br /> the view from the UK, the US and Eastern Europe.<br /> <br /> A two-day free ICT CPD workshop<br /> 12th 13th March 2008<br /> (optional school visits on Friday March 14th )<br /> WLE centre, Institute of Education (IOE), University of London,<br /> 20 Bedford Way, WCIH 0AL </p><p>To gain the most from this Workshop, participants should study the full details and the resources and essential reading list <a href="../etopia/www/index.htm"><strong>available on the site</strong></a>. </p><p><strong>Time table</strong><br />10:30am - 5:00pm 12th March including lunch and supper at 6:30pm<br />9:30am - 4:00pm 13th March including lunch <br />Optional London school visit on the 14th March<br /><br /><strong>Summary of the activity</strong><br />This international policy-orientated workshop focuses on the complexities of change in classrooms and on the designs for programmes about digital technologies that will support teachers as they manage these changes. The first aim is to investigate existing global models and plan for the future of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) in Information and Communications Technology (ICT). The second aim is to explore which learning experiences are most effective for teachers and which ones are counter-productive. A key aspect of the workshop is the opportunity for all participants to tell the story of their own learning journey in mastering digital technologies.  All participants are invited to contribute to a publication about ICT CPD experiences in an international context.<br /><br />The range of the topic is wide and multifaceted so there are six overarching themes: <br /></p><ul><li>the relationship between theory, pedagogy and learning;</li><li>the relationship between work, learning and professional practice;</li><li>the relationship between pedagogy, assessment and learning;</li><li>the role of e-communities of practice in teachers&rsquo; learning:</li><li>cultural, national and professional diversity in ICT CPD programmes.</li></ul><p><strong>Who will gain from the workshop?</strong><br />The participants in this two-day ICT CPD workshop are expected to be policy makers, teacher educators and advisers, teachers, senior managers, students at the IOE and key commercial and university ICT training and CPD providers. This audience will be invited to engage in the thinking and contribute to the collaborative insights that emerge from a discussion of the evidence. We plan a web publication after this event that will include contributions from all attendees who have insights to offer. Applicants who register for the workshop will be given access to pre-reading research materials that outline what the speakers have discovered so far about ICT CPD in Eastern Europe, the US and the UK. Those who cannot attend but who wish to contribute to the publications can also register to access the website. <br />As part of this ICT CPD experience schools are invited to set up cross cultural exchanges between the participants and join the an optional visit to a London school on the 14th March,<br /><br /><strong>The workshop programme</strong><br /><br /><strong>Outline</strong><br />There will be two key subject areas discussed in this workshop;<br />international, national, regional and local policy foci in ICT CPD and the experiences of teachers in ICT CPD programmes.  The participants will be expected to contribute to discussions both about the background to ICT CPD provision and  about the critical incidents that have most influenced them in developing digital confidence and competence. These sessions will be based on a chronological framework devised by MirandaNet Fellows that links the progress of individual learning with the stages that a learning community goes through, At the end of the second day the participants will be invited to come to some conclusions about What Works Where which will contribute to joint publications.<br /><br /><strong>Day One &ndash; 10-00 am &ndash; 5:00pm</strong><br />10:00 Refreshments and introductions<br />10:30 &ndash; 12:00 Workshop One : ICT CPD in England<br />Christina Preston, John Cuthell, MirandaNet Fellowship.

The ICT they encounter in educational contexts fails to reflect their leisure use of electronic communications media. Extra-curricular ICT use is leaking into classrooms, and the ripples are beginning to worry teachers and school leaders. School ICT use can no longer be thought of as a walled garden, in which young people can be insulated and isolated from outside influences. Is it only the teachers who are unaware of the world outside?</p><p>Following on from our online discussion, in this informal forum members will explore some of the issues with young people&#39;s ICT use, their web communities and the social software that enables young people to create their own worlds - and sense of identity.</p><p>Members will discuss strategies for schools and their young people to work creatively and effectively with communications technologies, and gather evidence to inform policy makers and schools in their practice. We will also be looking for funding sources to begin a working party in 2007.</p><p>Please note: This meeting is instead of the meeting advertised for 1st December at the Institute of Education in London.
