<h2>New MirandaNet service for consultants</h2>
<p>Membership of the MirandaNet Fellowship has been free to members  since 1992.&nbsp; A small team of consultants donate their time and an  overhead from projects to pay the running costs of MirandaNet which is  an international not-for-profit professional organisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of our members are also consultants in digital technologies in  teaching and learning. Since Coalition government won the election last  year in England and the cut-backs have begun to bite these members are  reporting that although the market overseas is buoyant, consultancy work  is suffering from financial uncertainty in England.</p>
<p>We have, therefore, designed a new service for MirandaNet members who  are consultants in digital technologies in education. We are offering  to advertise members&rsquo; consultancy services on our new web zone (<a href="../consultancy/index.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/consultancy</a>).  This will cost &pound;25 a year for individuals and &pound;50 for groups who have  formed a consultancy company. This will also alert us to MirandaNet  members who might like to work on our projects.</p>
<p>We have a different scale of charges for companies who want to market  their education products and services to educators world-wide. This  membership promotion will be launched on our new consultancy website  which show-cases what kinds of projects the MirandaNet team undertake in  research, running unconferences, consultancies &nbsp;and continuing  professional development (<a href="../consultancy/index.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/consultancy</a>).</p>
<p>This promotion of consultant members will offer value for money as we  have more than 750 members in 80 countries. Our newsletters reach about  2,500 others. MirandaNet currently has over 750 members in 80 different  countries round the globe. The web site is well indexed and features  prominently in Google and&nbsp; other search results. The site is very well  patronised and on average over 1300 pages are viewed each day excluding  robots.These fees for advertising consultants will support the  maintenance of the website and also go towards expanding the MirandaNet  services to members.</p>
<p>Please apply to Christina Preston if you are interested in pursuing this opportunity further.</p>
<h2>Free MirandaNet services</h2>
<p>We would be glad to hear from members who have suggestions for other  services we can offer that will benefit from and develop MirandaNet&rsquo;s  international reputation for high quality services. This is our current  portfolio:</p>

<h2>New Fellows</h2>
<h3>Allison Allen</h3>
<p>We are delighted to award Allison Allen a Senior Fellowship for her  support for the MirandaNet Fellowship and her work in research into  digital technologies that is of outstanding value to our community.</p>
<p>For her Fellowship she has offered an article about models and  theories in relation to working with people and ICT evaluation of  courses.</p>
<p>You will find her article here:</p>
<p><a href="../consultancy/2011/models-and-theories-in-relation-to-working-with-people-and-ict-evaluation-of-courses/index.html">http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/consultancy/2011/models-and-theories-in-relation-to-working-with-people-and-ict-evaluation-of-courses/</a></p>
<p>Her Senior Fellowship award is based on the voluntary work she has  done developing MirandaNet activities and events and on several  publications: three have involved MirandaNet members:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ICT CPD Landscape in England: N. Pachler, C. Preston, J.  Cuthell and A. Allen (Becta 2010; published http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/1769/ )</li>
<li>New professional cultures: braided gatherings in The Third Space: Collaboration / MirandaNet</li>
<li>E-safety guidance for the FE &amp; Skills Sector: A. Allen, M. Payton, C. Preston and S. Pickering (Becta 2009; published <a href="http://tinyurl.com/esafety-FE-Skills-outstream">http://tinyurl.com/esafety-FE-Skills-outstream</a>)</li>
<li>Allison has also published other reports that may be useful to members</li>
<li>Through the Looking Glass (and What Alice Found There) &ndash;  e-Safety concepts and misconceptions: A Allen (ICT Skills Briefing,  Issue 14, 2009): (also MirandaMod 2009)</li>
<li>Butterflies for the Use of ICT (DFES/London Challenge/LGfL): Collaboration Chair</li>
<li>Achieving Excellence &ndash; LGfL and the Becta Self Review Framework: (DFES/Croydon Council/LGfL/Outstream) Collaboration Chair</li>
</ul>
<h3>Roger Broadie</h3>
<p>We also have a new Fellow, Roger Broadie, who has contributed an  interesting piece about the cost of computers related to their value in  teaching and learning. Those are trying to justify the costs in these  straighten times will find some useful arguments in this article.</p>
<p>This quotation indicates the size of the task that Roger sets himself  in trying to establish a theory about the impact of ICT in the  classrooms.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There have been many attempts to study the impact of ICT on  achievement. It has proved possible to causally link certain uses of ICT  to raised achievement when these are limited in time and purpose &ndash; for  example us of revision software in the weeks leading up to exams.  However broader studies such as Becta&rsquo;s Impact2, analysis of the ICT  Test-bed schools and investigations by Ofsted have largely failed to  prove that use of ICT has caused raised achievement while at the same  time being able to show correlation between schools with good pupil  achievement and those making good use of ICT. Internationally there is a  paucity of studies showing that ICT has raised achievement in schools&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p>It is possible that this failure to link use of ICT with raised  achievement to any great extent is that it is fundamentally impossible  to do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger also provides some fascinating examples of innovative uses of  digital technologies in the classroom like the use of flip video  cameras.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you give the pupils a flip video camera and tell them they have  to choose to be a beetle or a butterfly (with a camera) making a  podcast, you get a whole new dimension.&nbsp; The beetles will all be lying  flat on the ground, crawling through the grass and pushing their camera  through the jungle of stalks, bumping into other bugs, looking up and  seeing huge birds and so on. The butterflies will hold their cameras  facing downwards and fly around swooping down towards brightly coloured  flowers&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>MirandaNet chapter launched In Zimbabwe.</h2>
<p>Ben Semwayo, chair of our Zimbabwean chapter and one of our senior  Fellows, has summed up a discussion in the group that will be used to  raise funding for the group&rsquo;s activities.</p>
<p>They have written a report about the kind of training that Zimbabwean  educators need now that Nelson Chamisa has announced that &ldquo;Zimbabwe is  on the verge of becoming an &ldquo;information tiger of the continent.&rdquo; This  announcement followed the commencement of the laying of an optic fibre  link connecting Zimbabwe to the Beira under-sea cable. Expectations are  high in Zimbabwe following news that the landlocked Southern African  state is on the verge of being wired to the rest of the world through an  undersea cable.</p>
<p>Desderio Chavunduka a Lecturer at Chinhoyi University of Technology  has compiled a report from the discussions in the new chapter. He is  pleased that they have had the chance to applaud this news and debate  the implication.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The first MirandaNet-Zimbabwe chapter discussion came up with the following recommendations: </em></p>
<p><em>The momentum generated by the president when he launched the  Presidential Computerization Programme which donated ten computers per  school to nearly all the secondary schools in the country in 2010 should  be continued. </em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The ministries of education should encourage their  institutions to take advantage of the fibre-optic back-bone that has  been laid. </em></li>
<li><em>The minister of finance, where possible, should add more resources to fund and extend his assistance to expedite connectivity. </em></li>
<li><em>The minister of ICT should spearhead connectivity,  especially in rural areas so that they do not lack basic access to the  Internet and related services and applications. One way of creating a  platform for in-depth deliberations on how universal access can be  achieved is through public-private partnerships. </em></li>
<li><em>Industry and commerce should partner with educational institutions to initiate and sponsor these ICT projects and services&rdquo;.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of this report is <a href="../ftp/MirandaNet_Zimbabwe_Discussion_Report.docx">available for download from MirandaNet</a>.  The chapter are particularly keen to come to BETT12 to learn about new  ICT practice, to develop contacts in English schools. They also want to  visit schools in other countries. &nbsp;Do you know of a source of funding we  can use to allow our Zimbabwean colleagues to travel? Let me us know if  you do: Benjamin Semwayo btsemwayo at yahoo.co.uk,&nbsp; christina at mirandanet.ac.uk</p>
<h2>Research news from Australia</h2>
<p>When we were in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia last year Marilyn  Leask and I talked to Elizabeth Hartnell-Young and her colleagues about  building professional communities on line. Elizabeth&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Office of Policy, Research &amp; Innovation were working on a the  development of new learning platform at the time. She has now sent for  members a link to the latest edition of our Research eLert newsletter at  <a href="http://www.eduweb.vic.gov.au/edulibrary/public/researchinnovation/marchelert.pdf">http://www.eduweb.vic.gov.au/edulibrary/public/researchinnovation/marchelert.pdf</a></p>
<p>She would like to receive feedback and ideas for collaboration:</p>
<p>hartnell-young.elizabeth.a at edumail.vic.gov.au</p>
<h2>Summarising MirandaLink debates</h2>
<p>A key aspect of our activity is debating current issues. Members are  encouraged to start debates on MirandaLink. We will always help you with  the wording if you feel you need this support. Fellowship awards are  available to members who initiate and summarise debates</p>
<p>For example, following a post by Tim Rudd on the ICT Research Network  on June 22, John Cuthell posted a message on MirandaLink the next day  which you might remember.</p>
<p><strong><em>Is there a specific brand of mobile learning device? Or has the iPad/iPhone label become, like </em></strong>'<strong><em>biro</em></strong>'<strong><em>, a generic name?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Colleagues who subscribe to the ICT Research Network listserv  will already have seen some interesting contributions to this debate.  There would appear to be a divide between mobile devices used by many  students in Higher Education and other learners. The suggestion is that,  whilst many HE students use iPhones and iPads, across other sectors of  education there is a more varied picture, with many learners using  Blackberries or Android devices. Indeed, the recently-published report </em>'<em>Safeguarding vulnerable young people online</em>'<em>,  by Stephen Carrick-Davies, identifies the role of Blackberries and  Android devices, and the reasons that young people use them. Ray Tolley  and Karl Royle have made similar observations.</em></p>
<p><em>What is the experience of colleagues in the MirandaNet network?</em></p>
<p><em>Could it be that, apart from other factors, Blackberry and  Android devices are available on tariffs that are more accessible to  young people?</em></p>
<p><em>I would be most interested in your observations.</em></p>
<p>John&rsquo;s final summary picks up the main points of the discussion.  These summaries are also useful to members who have to report on the  issue in hand.&nbsp; John&rsquo;s summary is <a href="../ftp/Mobile_devices_and_learners.doc">available for download from MirandaNet</a>.</p>
<p>Another summary was sent in by Lawrence Williams who had set up a debate:</p>
<p><strong>How do teachers learn about digital technologies?</strong></p>
<p>Lawrence Williams summed the debate he began &nbsp;like this:</p>
<p>The general theme seems to be that we should be looking to develop  independent, thinking teachers (rather than "trained" ones) who can  start to make their own judgments about what and how to use ICT tools  appropriately, while simultaneously steering them to develop the use of  on-line tools for collaboration, and the co-construction of knowledge.</p>
<p>This was, after all, Berners-Lee's purpose in creating the web, in  the first place! &nbsp;It's not his fault that the web turned, initially,  into a gigantic library. This accords well with my own views about how  web 2.0, in particular, needs to be understood - driving education away  from Gove-type learning objectives, towards a more radical approach to  learning, entirely. &nbsp;It's an exciting prospect.</p>
<p>Best wishes, and thanks for a stimulating debate.</p>
<p>Lawrence</p>
<p>ITT stands for Initial Teacher Thinking, rather than Training, courses. (?)</p>
<p>So are you ready to initiate a debate?</p>
<h2>Blog roundup</h2>
<p class="heading3">Learn4Life</p>
<p>Leon Cych has recorded and audioBoo interview with <a href="http://theok.typepad.com/">Theo Kuechel</a> for the <a href="http://purposed.org.uk/2011/05/announcing-the-next-campaign-purposedfutured/">#purposedfutured</a> campaign.</p>
<p>Theo answers to&nbsp; two questions:</p>
<p>A) How should we educate people in the future?<br /> B) What do we need to be doing now to enable that?</p>
<p>Leon says that Theo&rsquo;s&nbsp; response was typically pertinent, highly creative and very amusing. Worth looking at.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.l4l.co.uk/">http://www.l4l.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>You can also find the latest news about the Teachers&rsquo; TV resources on Leon&rsquo;s blog:</p>
<p class="heading3">Feedblitz</p>
<p>Terry Freedman has an interesting article about data protection on Feedblitz which comes from his ICT in Education blog:</p>
<p>Data protection is actually pretty easy. True, there are all the  legal niceties, and for some courses students have to learn all the  principles in the sort of detail that nobody except a lawyer can  remember. (A pretty pointless exercise too, given that you can always  look them up.) Even so, in my experience students find it easier to  learn stuff if they understand the underlying principles. Here are what I  believe the underlying principles of data protection to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t collect people&rsquo;s data unless you have permission.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t pass their details on to others, unless you have permission.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t misuse the data, eg by using for a different reason that they let you have it in the first place.</li>
<li>Look after the data, for example don&rsquo;t leave a laptop containing their personal details in the back of an unlocked car.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Merlin John on Line</h3>
<p>Merlin refers to a new research report by Don Passey bears evidence that ICT improves learning and saves time for teachers.</p>
<p>This independent research conducted by Don Passey, senior research  fellow at Lancaster University, reveals that digital resources which are  integrated into classroom work, and are used early with children can  improve their achievements. His study of the use of Espresso in primary  schools found that it saved teachers time and was associated with higher  scores in key stage 2 SATS.</p>

<h2>Stop press</h2>
<p>Look out for news of our eight MirandaMods at BETT12, 11th &ndash; 14th  January in the next bulletin. We are looking for researchers, policy  makers and practitioners to contribute to debates about the uses of  digital technologies in teaching and learning.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful summer,</p>
<p>Regards to you all,</p>
