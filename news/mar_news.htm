  <h2>March 2000</h2>
  <p>What a lot going on at present! First do not forget to sign up for the seminar 
    programme that runs from now till June. The first seminar took place on Friday 
    10th March but will be repeated in April. This was a fascinating session and 
    Alan the Alien stole the scene. Cannot guarantee he will be there in April 
    though, he is so in demand as a speaker.</p>
  <p>Ann Sparrowhawk is running a series of sessions on the subject of software 
    evaluation. These will be well worth going to. Apart from anything else you 
    can become an accredited evaluator which should prove useful. The session 
    on the 20th May will be followed by an introduction to the new skin for Think.Com 
    in the afternoon. Again, well worth attending.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>MirandaNet/TEEM : NGFL Professional Development seminars</li>
    <li>Seminar : Developing Software Evaluation Skills</li>
    <li>Dates: 20th May, 22nd May (same day as building Online communitiesseminar) 
      or 17th June</li>
    <li>Time: 9.30 a.m. - 12.30 p.m.</li>
    <li>Venue: Institute of Education, 20 Bedford Way, WC1H 2AL (Nearest Tube 
      Russell Square)</li>
    <li>Organiser: MirandaNet/TEEM (sponsored by Oracle)</li>
    <li>Audience : Teachers and advisors who want to understand more about the 
      use of software in the classroom.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This half day seminar, run by Anne Sparrowhawk from TEEM, aims to develop 
    teachers software evaluation skills as a means of professional development. 
    Teachers will be using the TEEM model of evaluation, which is supported by 
    the Department for Education &amp; Employment.</p>
  <p>In this seminar, focus will be mainly around Think.com. Teachers who have 
    trained to become TEEM evaluators are paid for completed evaluations and case 
    studies of software titles and these evaluations and case studies are published 
    on the web.</p>
  <p>Attendees will be invited to become Early Adopters of Oracle's Think.com.</p>
  <p>Further details about this model of evaluation can be found on the TEEM website 
    <a href="http://www.teem.org.uk/">www.teem.org.uk</a>. </p>
  <h3>Virtual Drives</h3>
  <p>Remember mainframes? All your stuff was miles away and access was dead slow 
    via a dumb terminal? well the latest incarnation of this idea uses the Internet 
    and is miles better. It is a sort of second cousin to Think.Com but with significant 
    differences. The two examples I am aware of are to be found at <a href="http://www.idrive.com/"> 
    www.idrive.com</a> and <a href="http://www.xdrive.com/"> www.xdrive.com</a>. 
    So a lot of imagination there then.</p>
  <p>What is it? Simply put some kind person offers you 25mb of space on his server. 
    You can store files, web pages, anything you want really. You upload from 
    your own machine using a system that looks rather like copying files from 
    your cd to your hard drive - except it is a lot slower. You can choose to 
    put files in a private directory or into a password protected public directory.</p>
  <p>Why would you want to do that? Suppose you have some data you always want 
    to be able to get at but you do not have a lap top. Put it on a virtual drive 
    and you can always access it from a web enabled computer. You can place files 
    you want other people to be able to use there as well and unlike a web site 
    you have control over who can access them. I will be in Australia this summer 
    but if I put my latest novel on my idrive site then I can do re-writes using 
    my brother's Mac - cos there is no way I'm lugging a computer around the world. 
    (The novel exists only in my dreams but you get the idea)</p>
  <h3>Jane's Bit</h3>
  <p>There is no Jane's bit this month! she is in Japan for some reason. But, 
    have you got a copy of her book yet? I have and a good read it is too. Excellent 
    value for money.</p>

  <h3>Visit Prague : 29th May - 2nd June 2000</h3>
  <p>Opportunity for MirandaNet Fellows/Scholars to participate and present at 
    a seminar with Czech Miranda on the 31st May in Prague. The seminar will be 
    based on teachers sharing their classroom activities and experiences. This 
    trip is unfunded so those interested in going to Prague will have to pay for 
    themselves. There are now flights to Prague from Stanstead with GO for &pound;70 
    and Boba Mannova is able to get hotel rooms for participants for approx &pound;20 
    per night. Anyone interested in this trip needs to get in touch with Tina 
    quickly. Presentations can be on power-point, on-line or just eye-balling 
    Hopefully there will also be a social programme - those who were there in 
    98 will know what that portends.....</p>
  <p>From Tony Fisher comes the following. <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/">www.lighthouse.org.uk</a> 
    Lighthouse is a video and digital arts organisation. At their website, in 
    the education section (move your pointer across the squares at the top of 
    their interactive homepage) you will find some outcomes of exciting work done 
    in schools involved in the Brighton Media Arts Project. IMHO some of this 
    work is stunning and, for those of us who, like me, didn't realise, shows 
    the degree of sophistication of what kids can achieve with new media. Raising 
    standards is about more than numeracy and (print) literacy!</p>
  <p>Party with Mara and Friends Oracle are sponsoring an International Gala Evening 
    at Hermitage Primary School on Saturday April 8th, starting at 7p.m. There 
    will be musicians and artists from Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, America and the East 
    End and celebrity appearances from the casts of &quot;Brookside&quot; and 
    &quot;From Hero to Zero&quot;. Lots of great crafts, auctions, raffle prizes- 
    Playstation and games, portable CD player, tickets for Mamma Mia and the Lion 
    King, booze, meals out, beauty treatments and lots more.</p>
  <p>A great night is promised- do come and support us. Tickets are &pound;5 / 
    &pound;2 schoolchildren (&pound;1 off each if booked in advance). Proceeds 
    are going to be used to enrich the children's literacy experience with music, 
    art and drama. Should be fun!</p>
  <h3>Miranda Roses this month from John Potter</h3>
  <p>We think the March Educational Site of the month should go to Stories from 
    the Web - a wonderful interactive book-oriented site supported by libraries 
    in Birmingham, Bristol and Leeds. It features, stories, reviews and interviews 
    with authors (like the amazing Ms. Rowling) written by children. <a href="http://hosted.ukoln.ac.uk/stories/">hosted.ukoln.ac.uk/stories/</a></p>
  <p>And the Education Support Site to Wordpool for the quality and range of support 
    it offers teachers... <a href="http://www.wordpool.co.uk/">www.wordpool.co.uk</a></p>
