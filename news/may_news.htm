  <h2>May 2000</h2>
  <p>First of all - Congratulations to Robert and Michele Ellis on their new baby. 
    This has marked a worrying outbreak of fertility among MirandaNetters - congrats 
    to Colin Cadney and David Perry too! I note that Isobel's full initials will 
    be IDE but assume this is pure coincidence and not work fixation taking over.. 
    Talking of which, if this newsletter is late - yet again - I am employing 
    the &quot;Threshold Application Excuse Mk1&quot;. It has taken me days to 
    pull together the stuff for my application and I still do not know if what 
    I have written will push the right buttons to get me over. SEN Coordinators 
    do not do the same kinda stuff as everyone else - at least I don't. I coordinate. 
    I don't think anything any government has done to education has annoyed me 
    so much for a long time. Think of the demotivation and strife when people 
    do not get across the threshold. Anyway, enough - Tina will probably tell 
    me to cut the foregoing so the other excuse is that I've been in Prague - 
    and many thanks to Boba for her hospitality.</p>
  <h3>Jane's bit</h3>
  <h4>Think.com</h4>
  <p>Listening to mirandalinks, personal emails, and talk at the Professional 
    Development seminars, I'm beginning to wonder if think.com has lost it's grip 
    on what young people find important. You only have to listen to mobile phone 
    conversations to realise that it's not 'what you have to say' but 'where you 
    are' that counts. It's got more difficult to know 'where you are' on the new 
    version of the learning environment software.</p>
  <p>Some people have been finding the new software less intuitive than before. 
    Others say the transition isn't so difficult, but it's less easy to find your 
    way around (navigation buttons change according to where you find yourself) 
    and that the sense of community has been lost (no little faces to show who 
    else is on-line).</p>
  <p>Can we have some views from people who haven't responded so far - whether 
    you like it or dislike it. There's a new button now on the front page at <a
href="http://www.think.com/">www.think.com</a> which gives new users more information 
    about the product. Read it; it's illuminating.</p>
  <h4>Links</h4>
  <p>The May Educational-site-of-the-Month has been awarded to Learn.co.uk - part 
    of Guardian Unlimited; a new site, launched this May, that aims to offer UK 
    school students and teachers top quality on-line lessons and learning materials. 
    It's still being built, but is worth looking at. <a href="http://www.learn.co.uk">www.learn.co.uk</a></p>
  <p>The Community-site-of-the-Month MirandaRose Award goes to Trace Online Writing 
    Community - which exhibits good practice in the area of community-building 
    and energetic support to learners in writing at all stages. <a href="http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/">trace.ntu.ac.uk</a></p>
  <p>Your groups could take the on-line lessons in good writing at the Guardian 
    site and then put them into practice at trAce.</p>
  <p>And, as always, there are the new month's links at <a
href="../resources/linksnew.htm">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/links/linksnew.htm</a></p>
  <h4>Site News</h4>
  <p>Remember to keep looking at the Diary which has details of MirandaNet and 
    associated seminars on it. June offerings are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>5 June: Maintenance and Motivation of Online Communities</li>
    <li>17 June: Developing Software Evaluation Skills</li>
    <li>20 June: The Electronic Challenge</li>
    <li>24 June: Rethinking Literacy in an Age of New Media</li>

  <p>____Jane Dorner______<br>
    <a href="http://www.editor.net">http://www.editor.net</a></p>
  <p>Jane came up with a great idea on Mirandalink - a FAQ for Think - here is 
    her starter.</p>
  <p>Q1. I can't get think.com to remember my username and password?</p>
  <p>A. No, it doesn't. I assume that this is a security thing for privacy on 
    networks, but a dead bore for those with personal machines. You will need 
    to remember your log-on ID.</p>
  <p>Q2. How do you include live URLs in articles? It was easy before - there 
    was a space at the bottom for up to 3 URLs. Have I missed something?</p>
  <p>A. No, You have to add HTML coding to the article - like this: Please Sir 
    Oracle's software converts that automatically to a live link when you save 
    (i.e. the blue bit will be Please Sir). It's better in some ways because you 
    can have the live link where you want in the article. But worse for people 
    who would rather not learn to code.</p>
  <p>Q3. I can't send email in Think.com</p>
  <p>A. No, there's a bug at the moment.</p>
  <p>Q4. Is there still a Scoop-type interface for pupils since for some it would 
    make use of the system easier?</p>
  <p>A. Yes. When you log in, you will see a Preferences button. Click on that 
    and change the box marked Skin to show Scoop. This will be more familiar (though 
    a darker purple than before). They're calling it Scoop Classic.</p>
  <p>Q5. I can't find my way about. Where am I in the system?</p>
  <p>A. You log in at your own personal space. It gives you a box which will have 
    'new' items in (currently everything is new at the switchover on 2 May). The<br>
    second box will show pages with higher 'hit-rates' than others - so you can 
    read what others (in your communities) are reading. The third box shows which 
    communities you belong to and what your status is. You can then go straight 
    into them. Try searching the big wide world of think.com too.</p>
  <p>Q5. What's the Gallery?</p>
  <p>A. Everything you have written is stored in the Gallery - and you can manage 
    it from there. At the moment, everything you had published before is published 
    now. If you want to withdraw an article from public view, but keep it in your 
    Gallery, you must do each item one at a time (there's supposed to be another 
    way, but it doesn't work). Go into your newspaper and select Edit Paper, choose 
    Edit Row and remove the article which you don't want on your paper. An archive 
    version will stay in your Gallery.</p>
  <p>To see what's in the Gallery, sort the contents by type and or name - click 
    on the top row heading words and it will sort.</p>
  <p>Q6. What does, 'Enter an name for you place' mean in the About section?</p>
  <p>A. The Help files online leave much to be desired. We need to wait until 
    the software has matured a little.</p>
  <p>So far no one else has posted FAQs but there must be loads. You don't need 
    the answer - just the question - but if you post it with FAQ in the message 
    header then we could get them all together and bung it up on Think - or MirandaNet's 
    home page. Hopefully others will have the answers!</p>

  <h4>Information, Education, ICT, Italy</h4>
  <p>Luigi Macri teaches English in an Italian secondary school. He is actively 
    involved in ICT projects and the integration of ICT to teaching. He is looking 
    for two or three European partners to set up a new project about information, 
    education, new technologies and the Internet. If you are interested, contact 
    him as soon as possible:</p>

  <h4>Revision Software</h4>
  <p>Tina prompted responses when she asked about revision software.</p>
  <blockquote>BBC Bite sized revision is well spoken of. MFL and Science (Physics) 
    praised in particular by Jeremy, who is just starting his GCSEs. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/home//revision/">www.bbc.co.uk/education/revision/</a><br>
    <span class="author">Francis</span></blockquote>
  <blockquote>And the GCSE English, English Literature and Business Studies info 
    also gets a very big thumbs up at Holy Cross.<br>
    <span class="author">Lawrence</span></blockquote>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Thank you - I'll endorse that!</p>
    <p>BBC Bitesize has TV programmes, a large website and print resources for 
      GCSE revision across 11 subjects and CD ROMs for maths and science. We also 
      produced this year for the first time resources on TV, the internet, CD 
      ROM and in print for the National Tests at KS3 called KS3 Bittesize, and 
      for KS2 called Revisewise. For websites across all phases please see <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/revision/">www.bbc.co.uk/revision</a></p>
    <p>69% of GCSE students have used some of the Bitesize GCSE resources and 
      research undertaken by Durham University showed that student's grades increased 
      between one half to a whole grade if they used Bitesize. We've also had 
      a lot of positive endorsement from teachers and students.</p>
    <p>I understand that Letts have the highest print sales.</p>
    <p>If it helps I'll see if someone can get some quotes for you.<br>

  <h3>NOF Training</h3>
  <p>Lilia got everyone going with her request for recommendations for NOF trainers! 
    Remember, Lilia wants primary training.</p>
  <blockquote>RMs Window Box training for primaries is very good. They have a 
    support site with all sorts of lesson plans and things. <a href="http://www.wbol.co.uk/">www.wbol.co.uk</a> 
    - have a look - there will be information there.<br>
    <span class="author">Basia</span></blockquote>
  <blockquote>RM's Training is called the Learning Schools Programme and is provided 
    in conjunction with the Open University. it is possible to gain accreditation 
    towards diplomas etc. It is more than just Window Box. They are also the recommended 
    provider for Newham LEA and many, many others. As the the actual quality of 
    the training or materials I don't have any first hand experience. However, 
    feedback seems to be positive from the two or three schools I know of who've 
    started with it.<br>
    <span class="author">John</span></blockquote>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>I hesitate to mention a provider that I have had some involvement with, 
      but as I'm secondary, and Lilia's request was for primary, I feel I can 
      be slightly unbiased when I say that Talent has got some good stuff for 
      the primary sector. The approach is a mixture of a short taught course, 
      web-based distance learning materials, on-line conferencing (using web-based 
      First Class), and school based classroom support. From the limited feedback 
      I've heard from the primary users, the face-to-face aspects are particularly 
      helpful - they get support, rather than being told to 'get on with it'. 
      It is an LEA based scheme, restricted to schools in the area around the 
      London Borough of Lewisham in SE London (see the red folder for exact details 
      of which London Boroughs are served), but it has the enormous advantage 
      over other NOF providers (are they unique in this?) in that you can 'try 
      before you buy' - if you have the web address, you can read all the materials.</p>
    <p>Have a look at <a href="http://www.talent.org.uk/">www.talent.org.uk</a></p>
    <p>I'd welcome personal feedback about these pages, which I can feed into 
      the Talent production team to make this an even better resource.<br>
      <span class="author">Francis      </span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>I asked a group of headteachers at a meeting yesterday about their experience 
      with NOF training providers. There are mixed feelings about the University 
      of North London, we've found it terrible and aren't going to ask teachers 
      to attend future sessions. There was strong enthusiasm for CLPE, we might 
      use them next time. People liked it because it wasn't based on distance 
      learning.</p>
    <p>I was shocked to find I was the only person speaking out against performance 
      related pay...<br>

  <h3>Lilia's school is equipped with iMacs....</h3>
  <p>Being an iMac school are you also on the MIPS list (Macs in Primary Schools
    - MIPS at onelist.com) and/or part of the 
    Macintosh Learning Community (mac-learning-community at mailbase.ac.uk)?
     You might want to ask if they have any experience of RM providing NOF training
    
    to non-standard sites!</p>
