<p><strong>MirandaNet Newsletter May 2010</strong></p>
<h2>MirandaNet Fellows around the World.</h2>
<p>Thanks to the WLE Centre, Institute of Education, University of  London I was able to take up invitation to talk about our MirandaNet  community of practice work in America, New Zealand, Australia and Japan.  All the talks were about the ways in which the MirandaNet community of  practice is learning to build, share and disseminate knowledge between  us regardless of our national boundaries.</p>
<p>Marilyn Leask and I left on the first plane out after the BA strike  at the end of March and returned at the end of April on the first plane  out of Tokyo after the volcanic ash chaos. Some of the passengers and  all the crew had been camping out for eight days. But there were no loud  celebrations either at take-off or on landing - most of us were English  after all!</p>
<p>The visit certainly proved that MirandaNet is an international group  of some strength. A particular joy was the opportunity to see at close  quarters where some MirandaNet Fellows live and work. While on the tour I  was generously entertained by Professor Niki Davis in New Zealand;  Paula Christophersen and Eva Dakich in Melbourne; Michelle Selinger and  Sandy Schuck in Sydney and Professor Hiroyuki Tanaka in Tokyo. Professor  Marilyn Leask who accompanied me in San Diego and Melbourne also  welcomed me to her family home in Beaudesert, near Brisbane in  Queensland where I met several members of her family and had an  opportunity to see the outback at first hand along with kangaroos and  wallabies.</p>
<p>The other Fellows who I met on the way were John Cuthell, Roger  Carlsen, Roberta Weber, Anne Fitzgibbon and Ian Gibson in the US,  Elizabeth Hartnell-Young, Christine Bedford and Bronwyn Stuckey in  Melbourne and Bronwyn Stuckey and Ian Gibson again in Sydney.</p>
<p>I was impressed in my journey at how MirandaNet Fellows are connected  in cities, towns and even in rural areas by reliable digital  connections. I even had access in a remote back packing hostel in  Akaroa, South Island, New Zealand high up over an inlet to the sea. The  wardens told us about the Internet facility before explaining the  outdoor kitchen, where to find the fresh herbs to add to our cooking,  the workings of the washing machine and the vagaries of the outdoor  shower. I suppose back-packers more than others are keen to connect when  they climb out of their tents!</p>
<p>This newsletter is a little different from usual: my reflections on  what is happening in ICT in education beyond the shores of Britain.  Being face to face with Fellows who have been with MirandaNet for a long  time was a wonderful chance to reflect on how we have influenced each  other over the years. What was even more stimulating was to meet the  communities they work with. Rather than talk about these dialogues in  chronological order I am going to describe them in the way that the  ideas seemed to braid together as I travelled. There are three sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ecological model of learning in communities</li>
<li>Learning in communities of practice</li>
<li>Building communities of practice from a company perspective</li>
</ul>
<h3>An ecological model of learning in communities</h3>
<p>Professor Niki Davis introduced the first version of her ecological  model for learning in school in London in March 2008. She has now  developed this model far further to inform any teacher educator or  adviser who hopes to effect change in teaching and learning.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/preston/images/change_stadium_small.jpg" border="0" alt="Niki Davis Change Stadium Diagram" width="600" height="325" /></p>
<p>Niki&rsquo;s model represents the ways in which schools are interconnected  with national policy makers and regional advisers as well as local  governors on the one hand, and, on the other hand with the parents and  their communities. Last time we meet in London. Lawrence Williams, a  senior MirandaNet Fellow, suggested a Coliseum-style diagram to  illustrate this theory. But now we need space in the Coliseum for the  local community and parents - we thought perhaps a concept map might  work better or a new environment in Second Life where MirandaNet now has  an island. Do any Fellows have ideas about the presentation of this  model that you can see above?</p>
<p>Niki and I recorded our conversation in New Zealand about digital  issues (it was also recorded for her students). We talk about the ways  in which this model feeds into the emergent Braided Learning Model which  I wrote about in an article for First Monday. This is about how  communities like ours use online communication to share, develop and  disseminate knowledge.</p>

<h3>Learning in communities of practice</h3>
<p>I spent a lot of time with Bronwyn Stuckey, both in Melbourne and Sydney. For more about Bron go to <a href="http://www.bronwyn.ws/">www.bronwyn.ws</a>.  Not only has she achieved so much in communities of practice theory and  practice but she has also engaged many MirandaNet teachers in Quest  Atlantis, a safe virtual world where young people make decisions about  World Citizenship. I hope we will see more of the pupils' work published  on our World Ecitizens site (<a href="https://wec.mirandanet.org.uk/">wec.mirandanet.org.uk</a>). We will reward them with a World Ecitizens certificate.</p>
<p>Bronwyn invited me to be a guest speaker on Skype for a group she  runs who are setting up communities of practice. They asked me some hard  questions about funding and sustaining MirandaNet that burrowed down to  some of the detail involved in maintaining a community of practice for  18 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen to Christina's Interview with Bronwyn on the <a href="../associates/quest_atlantis.htm">Quest Atlantis Section on MirandaNet</a></li>
<li>Bronwyn uses <a href="http://www.prettymay.net/callrecorder/"> PrettyMay</a> to record these group Skype conversations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quest Atlantis</strong><br /> Quest Atlantis is an online virtual world designed for school students  aged 9 yrs to 16 yr to engage in global e-citizenry while levelling up  in a game that requires completion of inquiry learning curriculum tasks.  Quest Atlantis is built on the best of current knowledge in games in  learning, motivation, global citizenry and values education. It sits as a  bridge between entertainment, education and social values.</p>
<ul>
<li>For information more information about Quest Atlantis,  workshops, Bronwyn Stuckey, and to hear Christina's interview, visit  about online training visit the <a href="../associates/quest_atlantis.htm">Quest Atlantis</a> section on MirandaNet: <a href="../associates/quest_atlantis.htm">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/associates/quest_atlantis.htm</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Building communities of practice from a company perspective</h3>
<p>Sitting around the swimming pool in her ultramodern house in Sydney,  Michelle Selinger recalled her days as an academic in the 1990s and the  problems we had with technology in those days. We remembered too Basia  Korczak an inspirational teacher and MirandaNet Fellow who died in her  forties. Michelle then talks about her 10 years in Cisco where she has  been working in 30 countries. She has been working on key projects in  Continuing Professional Development in Jordan and Bangalore focusing on  people in collaboration instead of the technical network. We are hoping  to work with Michelle on technologies that will help to connect teachers  in remote areas in several different countries. The main aim will be to  keep them in these areas instead of moving to the towns. Another of  Michelle&rsquo;s projects concerns connecting Ingenious Schools around the  world.</p>

<h3>April 2010: Observations on America, New Zealand, Australia&hellip;.</h3>
<p>I have written a more general article about the countries I have  travelled through. This is too long to fit in here, and there are some  nice pictures too, so you need to go to MirandaNet:</p>

<h3>MoLeaP - The Mobile Learning Project Database</h3>
<p>Learning with digital and portable technologies is becoming  increasingly popular in a range of educational settings, be they school,  apprenticeship, working life or out-of-school contexts. Teachers and  education professionals across the world are carrying out a multitude of  projects. It is not longer possible to retain an overview and projects  often remain ephemeral because they are not documented systematically.  In order to strengthen the sustainability of mobile learning projects  and to make them available and replicable for a broad audience the  London Mobile Learning Group (LMLG: <a href="http://www.londonmobilelearning.net/">www.londonmobilelearning.net</a>) developed "MoLeaP - The mobile learning project database".</p>
<p>MoLeaP is a public and free-of-charge online database for teachers,  researchers and other (education) professionals interested in learning  and teaching with mobile media. Practitioners are invited to contribute  their projects to MoLeaP in order to make them accessible to interested  parties.</p>
<p>Judith Seipold and Norbert Pachler have written an article that will be published in the Spring 2010 issue of <strong>RCETJ</strong>,  special conference issue with contributions from Handheld Learning  2009, entitled "MoLeaP - The Mobile Learning Project Database: a pool  for projects and tool for systematic description and analysis of mobile  learning practice". The text, which will soon be available at <a href="http://www.rcetj.org/">www.rcetj.org</a>,  gives an overview of the structure of the database and its theoretical  and conceptual underpinnings and it discusses a sample project. MoLeaP  can be accessed at <a href="http://www.moleap.net/">www.moleap.net</a>.</p>
<h3>Resources from the Games Based Learning Conference</h3>
<p>MirandaNet ran a well attended MirandaMod at the Games Based Learning  conference. After the event Graham Brown Marting reports: the Game  Based Learning Conference was attended by more than 400 international  delegates for a stimulating, inspiring and possibly exhausting 2 days.</p>
<p>By all accounts it was a success with engaging and provocative  conversations sparked during the event itself, on Twitter where the  event consistently trended and now continuing amongst various online  communities.</p>
