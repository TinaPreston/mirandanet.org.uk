  <p>MIRANDANET END-FEBRUARY 2003 NEWSLETTER</p>
  <p>1. NEWS FROM MIRANDANET COLLEAGUES AWAY FROM HOME</p>
  <p>We asked for a news item from Richard Robinson who has moved to George V 
    School in Hong Kong and this is what he sent. He would also like news from 
    home. Contact him at ginger_richuk@yahoo.com</p>
  <p><strong>Teaching in Hong Kong.</strong></p>
  <p>Having spent four excellent years teaching at Boston Spa Comprehensive School 
    in Leeds I decided to fulfil a personal ambition and work abroad for a while. 
    I accepted a job with the English Schools Foundation in Hong Kong.</p>
  <p>I arrived in August of last year to teach at King George V School which is 
    on the mainland side of Hong Kong, in Kowloon.</p>
  <p>The school is funded part by student fees and partly by the Hong Kong Government. 
    The school does not select by ability. The only criteria is that students 
    pass an English Language test. Of the 1,500 students, about 85% are Hong Kong 
    returnees, essentially students who have returned to Hong Kong after living 
    abroad, often in Canada or the USA. The remaining percentage is made up a 
    variety of nationalities.</p>
  <p>Teaching in the school is quite different from England. There is calm atmosphere 
    that pervades throughout, if a student is running in the corridor it is a 
    rare sight and usually because they think they might be late for a lesson! 
    There is a respect for teaching and teachers within the school and in Hong 
    Kong in general that is very refreshing - when people find out that you are 
    a teacher they are genuinely thrilled and impressed.</p>
  <p>It was impossible not to arrive with preconceptions, and I expected the academic 
    level to be far higher than in the UK. On reflection that was naive, and incorrect. 
    The amount of work that the top students put in, though, is quite unbelievable, 
    indeed many have tutors outside school for the main subjects. This is all 
    tied in with the expectations and pressures they face to get the right grades. 
    I had one student who sat her IGCSE English Language Exam in November and 
    got an 'A,'. However she asked if she could resit as she felt she should have 
    got an A*!</p>
  <p>However one of the growing issues in the school is the increasing number 
    of students with EAL support needs. I teach a bottom set in Year 9, and whilst 
    the behaviour is not an issue, there are many who are incredibly weak and 
    need an awful lot of support.</p>
  <p>I had intended to keep my links with MirandaNet during my time here. However 
    my first set back was the news that Think.com is not, as yet, allowed to be 
    used in China. </p>
  <p>This is a real shame as I think the situation here would help it work wonderfully. 
    Broadband is the norm in Hong Kong, so connection is effortless. This was 
    always the biggest stumbling block when I used it in Leeds, as students lost 
    interest waiting for the dial-up connection. </p>
  <p>I have noticed that students use computers in slightly different ways here. 
    Whilst there is the usual use of Messenger and social emails, there are groups 
    of students who create write magazines about their mutual interests, there 
    are also far more students with individual websites and much more use of the 
    Internet as a normal extension to their studies. </p>
  <p>There is also a big desire from the ESF to widen its links with the local 
    Chinese schools and I think this could be one way of aiding that.</p>
  <p>And the school is very well-resourced too, with digital cameras, video-cameras 
    and an editing suite. So it would be great if we could get involved somehow!</p>

  <p>2. TOOLS FOR SCHOOLS MOBILES DONATED BY TOSHIBA a report by LIZ SMITH</p>
  <p><strong>Toshiba Laptop Project</strong></p>
  <p>I am using 10 laptops donated by Toshiba with two disaffected groups. The 
    first is a group of year 11 students. These students are foundation level 
    entry, however with extra support in class and after school I am hoping to 
    enter a handful for the intermediate exam in order for them to achieve the 
    possibility of GCSE grade C.</p>
  <p>The year 11's used the laptops to write up their handling data coursework. 
    Half way into the coursework, after the students had planned their ideas and 
    processed their data, the laptops were introduced. The motivational effect 
    of the laptops was immense. The concentration of all students had doubled. 
    They were all 'glued' to the screens, deciding how to analyse their results. 
    Giving them the responsibility of taking their laptop home over a weekend 
    was also amazing. Students who previously had not completed homework without 
    any threats of detention, or phone calls home, went out of their way at the 
    end of the day to come back to Maths and collect their computer, so they could 
    complete the work.</p>
  <p>The second group is a year 10 group. They will be using research skills to 
    demonstrate their understanding of new topics, and by using new skills and 
    Powerpoint, explain to their peers. I'll let you know how this shapes up.</p>
  <p>3. TWO NEW SCHOLARS</p>
  <p><strong><a href="../fellowship/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=341.html">Dr Daith&iacute; &Oacute; 
    Murch&uacute;</a></strong>, from TCD and MIC, Ireland says he has had a busy 
    year starting with his secondment to University of Limerick's Teacher Preparation 
    College, being a Research Fellow in Trinity and gaining an Honorary Doctorate 
    from the USA.</p>

    will be presenting papers on a wide variety of topics, co-presenting with 
    Roberta, Dean, Jani, et al. and also co-presenting with Eileen Freeman TCD.

    will be providing as their qualifying route for Fellowship status. </p>
  <p>4. HERMITAGE SCHOOL AND REBELLION IN MULTIMEDIA CITIZENSHIP PROJECT</p>
  <p>Hermitage School in Wapping, in conjunction with the Creative Partnerships 
    initiative, has linked up with Rebellion, a computer games company and filmmakers, 
    Mark and Mmoloki, to initiate a citizenship project that will allow schoolchildren 
    to learn about social issues and express them in comic strip and film forms. 
    MirandaNet is supporting this venture. </p>
  <p>The project will focus on the important issue of homelessness, investigating 
    how people end up living on the streets, what homeless life is like and how 
    people are able to reintegrate into society after a period of destitution. 
    This project will be an important part of the school's citizenship syllabus, 
    as well as an aspect of the creative arts curriculum. Pupils will learn how 
    to understand the causes of social problems such as homelessness, and how 
    society can help people who find themselves in this unfortunate situation.</p>
  <p>Pupils will be encouraged to read the stories of three homeless people, and 
    will learn all the techniques and steps involved in turning them into comic 
    strip stories, including drawing, inking and colouring, with the assistance 
    of professional comic artist and youth worker, Steve. At the end of the project, 
    pupils will have created a complete comic story, which will be published on 
    the web. </p>
  <p>Pupils will also have the chance to create a film on the issues of homelessness, 
    working with filmmakers Mark and Mmoloki. They will be taught how to use a 
    video camera, and will learn a number of filming techniques that will allow 
    them by the end of the project to have completed a film that documents the 
    project.</p>
  <p>Part of the project will involve pupils going out of school under the supervision 
    of a teacher to study life on the streets and to video material for the film 
    aspect of the project. </p>
