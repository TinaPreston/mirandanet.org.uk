        and Strategic Concerns Debate on MirandaLink</h2>
   <p>Earlier in 2007 there was  detailed debate on this topic on MirandaLink,
	  started by a posting from <a href="../fellowship/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=664.html">Allison
    Allen</a>.</p>
	<p> The MirandaNet community responded with a large number of posts to Allison
      Allen&#8217;s concerns about the redundancies amongst ICT advisers in the
      UK. What we found was that the national ICT community is observing a number
      of actions and attitudes which are raising urgent and serious concerns
      about the future of Strategic Technologies in education and impact on the
      Gross National Product. <a href="../fellowship/debate.htm"><em>More...</em></a></p>

	<h2 id="cave">CAVE Technology: the Future of Education?</h2>
    <p>&quot;CAVE stands for Cave Automated Virtual Environment. A CAVE is a 3D visual
      computing environment that recreates space and allows the educator or researcher
      to interact and visualize complex shapes in an interactive 3D environment.
    It is a multi-person, room-sized, high-resolution 3D video and audio environment.&quot;</p>
    <p>If you've ever wondered what CAVE technology is, MirandaNetter Mechelle
      de Craene gives a brief summary on her blog, complete with an example picture
      (scroll the page with a wheel mouse to get the full effect) and links to,
      well, everything including Plato's Republic. Erudite readers will immediately
      say 'ah yes,
      the cave
      analogy'.

    <h2 id="papert">Seymour Papert injured in Hanoi</h2>
    <p>MirandaNetters will have been shocked to hear the news that Seymour Papert 
      (<a href="http://www.papert.org/">www.papert.org</a>), 'world's foremost 
      expert on how technology can provide new ways to learn', inventor of Logo 
      and author of <em><strong>Mindstorms</strong>: Children, Computers and Powerful 
      Ideas</em>, has been hit by a motorbike in Hanoi and has suffered severe 
      head injuries (6 Dec 2006). Following an operation to remove a blood clot, 
      he is reported to be in a critical but stable condition. MirandaLink, our 
      internal message system, has been buzzing with <a href="seymour.htm">messages</a> 
      wishing him a speedy recovery and reminiscing on the seminal influence he 
      has had on ICT in Education. The following contribution was sent by MirandaNet 
      Fellow Douglas Butler, who was at the conference in Hanoi where Seymour 
      suffered this accident. Douglas also sent the picture of Seymour speaking 
      at the conference (<a href="../images/Seymour.jpg">click to enlarge)</a>, 
      and also a picture of <a href="../images/100dollar.jpg">Seymour's 100 dollar 
      computer</a>.</p>

        Greetings to all Mirandanetters, from Hanoi</strong><br>
        <br>
        As possibly the only Mirandanet Fellow attending the ICMI Study Conference 
        on Technology in Mathematics Teaching here in Hanoi, I can pass on a few 
        observations. Seymour's opening keynote was totally memorable - here was 
        the 79 year old genius we had all revered for his work with Logo, and, 
        now I read on his website, so much more.<br>
        <br class="clear">
        <a href="../images/100dollar.jpg"><img src="../images/100dollar.jpg" alt="$100 Laptop - click to enlarge" width="100" height="90" class="imageRight" title="$100 Laptop - click to enlarge"></a>We 
        all found his main theme was inspirational - to encourage us all to reserve 
        10% of our work to look at the 'bigger picture'. He also brought along 
        the first pre-production $100 laptop for us to see, and he nearly got 
        it going for his talk! No moving parts, all flash memory, wireless internet, 
        and driven by open source software. He was able to announce that a number 
        of developing countries are planning to order large quantities.<br>
        <br>
        That day we had all been joking about the Russian roulette of crossing 
        the very wide road by the campus - a marked zebra which was totally ignored 
        by the hundreds of mopeds constantly streaming by. The next day it was 
        no joke at all, and poor Seymour was in hospital. A dreadful and unnecessary 
        accident. This was one of the major roads in Hanoi still not controlled 
        by any traffic lights or pedestrian signals. The only stroke of good fortune 
        was that the excellent French hospital was close by. I am not aware of 
        any recent bulletins, so we all continue to pray for his recovery.<br>
        <br>
        The conference is over and the hard work begins - to write it up!<br>
        We also visited one of Hanoi's three elite schools, a large and imposing 
        institution on the shore of West Lake (built by the French). 3000 students 
        aged 15-18. They were handsome, alert, articulate and friendly. If the 
        future of Vietnam is in their hands we had all better take note - this 
        is a country on the rise! </p>

      Informatics Matura Examination</h2>
    <p>Ewa Kolczyk (see picture) has recently (Nov 06) published a study of the 
      new <strong>Polish Informatics Matura Examination</strong>, which contains 
      a comparison with the equivalent Information Technology AS/A level exam 
      in the UK.</p>
    <blockquote class="clear"> 
      <p class="block"><strong>Abstract</strong>. One element of the recent educational 
        reform in Poland is the qualification system, which consists of several 
        types of external examinations. The results of the Matura examinations, 
        taken at the end of secondary education, are now replacing entrance examinations 
        to universities, and to other institutions of higher education. The informatics 
        Matura examination, considered as an outcome of the secondary curriculum, 
        and as a regulation for informatics education, could play a significant 
        role in the process of improving school education in this discipline. 
        We decided to compare computing A-level examination in England with the 
        informatics Matura examination in Poland. The comparison is conducted 
        on different levels: subject criteria, scheme of assessment, examples 
        of tasks, examiners reports.</p>

    <p>We had our first MirandaNet workshop in Prague in 1997 so ten years after 
      it seems a good idea to repeat this success. If you do not work in the UK 
      it might be a good idea to see if the British Council in your country might 
      fund you to come. </p>

    Hook</a>, from the Oracle Foundation, has sent details of the latest version 
    of Think.com. Many MirandaNet members have already used Think for various 
    projects. This version extends its functionality even further. Oracle have 
    supported MirandaNet for many years, and many MirandaNetters already know 
    &#8211; and use &#8211; <a href="../associates/think.htm">Think.com</a> from Oracle. 
    The program has gone through a new development, and the latest version of 
    Think.com, coming in August 2006, introduces a new <span class="red">Projects 
    Space</span>. This enables teachers to easily organise their students into 
    working groups and run projects. </p>
  <p>The teacher, in a role as facilitator and guide can create projects and challenges 
    that motivate students to experience and explore relevant, real-world problems 
    and issues. The Project Space provides students with the tools and discussion 
    forums to present their findings, and to create products to share with others 
    what they have learned. Teachers can create projects that within their schools, 
    or join with other schools and students from around the world. (<a href="../associates/think.htm">More

  <h2 id="pelrs">Developing Pedagogies for E-learning Resources (PELRS)</h2>
  <p><a href="http://www.pelrs.org.uk/"><img src="../images/pelrs_logo.gif" alt="PELRS: Transforming the way we learn" title="PELRS: Transforming the way we learn" width="200" height="80" class="imageRight"></a>Bridget 
    Somekh was the first academic that MirandaNet invited to run a workshop in 
    1994. Her PALM project in the early nineties provoked our interest in action 
    research which we now call practice-based research. Bridget has sent us the 
    summary of findings of her latest project called Developing Pedagogies for 
    E-learning Resources Project (PELRS for short).</p>
  <p>This was a 3 year project exploring the innovative uses of ICT in teaching 
    and learning, based at <a href="http://www.ioe.mmu.ac.uk/">Manchester Metropolitan 
    University Institute of Education</a>. The <a href="http://www.gtce.org.uk/">General 
    Teaching Council</a> was a key sponsor in terms of both funding and advisory 
    support. For the first 2 years of the project 4 case study schools developed, 
    tested and refined new pedagogic strategies to maximise the potential of e-learning 
    resources.</p>
  <p>The 2003 context in which the project began was that schools in England had 
    invested heavily in new technologies recently. Many schools were now equipped 
    with computer suites, high speed internet connections and had access to digital 
    equipment such as laptops, interactive whiteboards, digital still cameras, 
    digital video cameras, and scanners. Research suggested that schools were 
    now looking for ways of using this technology to maximum effect to provide 
    high-quality interactive learning experiences for pupils. But the culture 
    of schooling, and the daily routines and procedures which structure the school 
    day were slow to change, with the result that much of the potential of this 
    technology was being wasted&#8221;.</p>
  <p> The <a href="../publications/pelrs.htm">PELRS report</a> praises teachers for their keenness 
    to challenge a narrow and transmissive model of teaching and learning. The 
    results provide some thoughtful pointers about the 'innovative' pedagogy which 
    is possible if teachers are well supported in making changes in classrooms.

  <p><a href="http://www.inspiration.com/ie/"><img src="../images/inspiration_logo.jpg" alt="Inspiration" title="Inspiration" width="196" height="54"style="float:left; padding: 5px"></a>Members 
    of the Miranda Net Fellowship agree that ownership of learning processes is 
    an important factor both in raising standards and in making learning more 
    constructive and learner-driven. Drawing maps for individual and group analysis 
    is important in this approach to learning. In this context the members welcome 
    the addition of mind-mapping in <strong>Inspiration version 8</strong>. In 
    fact, mapping has been such a successful strategy for promoting learning in 
    classroom pilots that this professional organisation is exploring the same 
    techniques in developing teachers' capacity to evaluate their own learning 
    about ICT. The maps are being piloted as a key tool in action research projects 
    both in classrooms and as a self-assessment tool for teachers. In particular 
    this group has explored non-linear writing and multimodal literacy. By talking 
    about the maps in groups teachers begin to understand their own concepts about 
    ICT in comparison with the views of colleagues. Teachers' ideas about ICT 
    change and expand in these discussion face to face and online. They also become 
    more articulate about their ICT knowledge and understanding.</p>
