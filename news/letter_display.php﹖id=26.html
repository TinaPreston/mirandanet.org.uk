<p><strong>MirandaNet People Newsletter</strong></p>
<strong>MirandaNet Fellows supporting World Ecitizens projects </strong><p> We have a vibrant and busy MirandaNet community online, but there comes a time when friendships need to be renewed face to face and new projects planned. This summer we are inviting members and friends to attend four ICT CPD events which we hope will be opportunities for members of our community to devise projects that they can do together. You will find all the details on the website. </p><p>At all these events we are hoping to raise funding for teachers and students to travel as part of their projects through World Ecitizens (WE) bursaries. WE is the new MirandaNet Fellows&rsquo; charity which aims to encourage understanding between peoples and communities and to share the fascinating diversity within nations and across the world. </p><p> We have so many ICT experts amongst our membership that everyone who joins in will have much to learn and much to give. We draw widely from the whole education community: some are classroom practitioners, supply teachers and teacher assistants, some are senior managers and policy makers and others are representatives of the ICT companies who support our activities. This rich mix should mean that we are able to support a wide range of projects between schools and communities. These events are being held in London and at the MirandaNet Academy which is based at Bath Spa University College. <br /> Please make all bookings through Lynne Coombs.  </p><p>  <strong>Auntie Edith&rsquo;s donation to WE</strong></p><p> Lawrence Williams pops up again because his Auntie Edith, soon to be 90, is the first person to donate to World Ecitizens. Please send ideas for creative ways to make best use of our first &pound;50. </p><p> Lawrence tells us how this donation came about&hellip;. </p><p> My Aunt, Edith Jones, has long been a financial supporter of my ICT lecturing travels around the world, especially the work I have done over the last ten years for the Charles University in Prague, at the Poskole conferences. She has recently shown great interest in the new MirandaNet World Ecitizens Project, especially the WE eLapa project with Free State, South Africa, and has donated &pound;50 to support this work. Amazingly, at 90, she has just become an email user! She is now in regular email contact with my children who have been studying in Birmingham and Cambridge, as well as with the rest of the wider family. One is never too old to learn new ICT skills. Some years ago, now, Professor Hiro Tanaka, from Osaka Kyoiku University, and currently at King&rsquo;s College, London invented the new acronym, ICFT, where the F stands for Friendship. Now it also stands for Family.</p><p>  <strong>Lynne Coombs - The New MirandaNet Manager</strong></p><p> Having been in public service all my working life the philosophy and ethical nature of MirandaNet appealed immensely. It was with great pleasure that I agreed to be the MirandaNet Manager in April. Thank you, MirandaNet, for this opportunity. I hope to get to know the members in due course especially as I am organizing and attending the workshop in Bath, Collaborating at the Boundaries of the Possible. <a href="../profdev/bath_cpd_photos.htm" target="_self">Do book soon</a>. </p><p>I would like to take the opportunity to introduce myself. For many years I worked in the fields of education and social work, starting many years ago as a primary teacher and a teacher of adult literacy. After a number of years life as a student sounded appealing and I gained from Bath University a Sociology Degree along with a social work qualification. </p><p>Initially I taught a variety of social science related subjects in Further Education Colleges in Wiltshire and Cornwall, where I also organized training courses for Social Services. It then felt the right time to concentrate on social work and I worked for 10 years as a field social worker in a local Children&rsquo;s Team. During this period I was Secretary of the British Association of Social Workers and became a teacher of social work students within the field office. </p><p>Towards the end of the 90&rsquo;s I had a welcome break and travelled to Singapore and California with my husband, who is the director of the MirandaNet Academy at Bath Spa University. We returned in 2002 to enjoy a cooler climate and grandchildren. Since then I have worked part-time as an Academic Support Tutor to those students assessed as having special needs at university. </p><p> Thank you, MirandaNet, for this opportunity to be part of a community of practice. I&rsquo;m looking forward to this. See you in Bath. Lynne Coombs  </p><p> <strong>MirandaNet  London Office, Mayfair</strong></p><p>  This is now our registered address for MirandaNet Ltd, the consultancy, where we can hold official meetings.<br /> MirandaNet, 15 Stratton Street, Mayfair, WLJ 8LQ<br /> The road is just opposite the Ritz!<br /> The Royal Academy is not so far, and there&#39;s a very good Waterstones at the other end of Piccadilly.</p><p>   <strong>NEW FELLOWS</strong></p><p>  <strong>Margaret Danby </strong> <br />Margaret is an education consultant specialising in the use of ICT for teaching and learning and in the professional development of teachers. She has considerable experience in project management, evaluation, quality assurance and inspection, and the development and delivery of training programmes and materials for teachers. </p><p>  <strong>NEW SCHOLARS </strong></p><p>  <strong>Miles Berry  </strong> <br /> I&#39;m deputy head and information systems manager of St Ives School, Haslemere, a small prep school for girls. My educational interests include schools as learning organizations, knowledge management in education, independent learning, and social constructivism, these latter with particular regard to mathematics education. In computing, St Ives has used open source software where appropriate, and has pioneered the use of virtual learning environments in primary aged education. We&#39;re interested in exploring further applications of open source web-based applications in this context, such as wikis and blogging. I&#39;m a member of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications and the British Computer Society, and am presently working towards an MBA in educational management. </p><p> <strong>Paulet Brown  </strong><br />I am currently reading for my PhD in education with emphasis on pupils&#39; literacy learning during the first year after transfer to secondary school. This study emerged from a project based in London with students who were at risk of academic achievements. </p><p> Originally, I am from The Bahamas and it is here where I began my formal training in Child Development. I continued my training in the United States where I completed two additional degrees, the first in Early childhood education (Hons) and the second in Curriculum and instructions (Hons). While in the United States, I worked within a Family Literacy center where I thought English as an Additional Language to refugees. In addition, I worked with the National Writing Project where I facilitated reading and writing projects. As you can see I am no stranger to working with projects. Since moving to London to begin studies, I have worked with MirandaNet on a few research projects in the capacity of research assistant. This relationship with MirandaNet provided an opportunity to explore the ideas of establishing a link within the schools in The Bahamas and introducing a new phase to an already existing IT program. We have been running an IT program for students in grade 4 (Year4) which has proven to be a success and is now expanding to all the primary schools in The Bahamas. With this in mind, I hope to make a formal proposal to our government, specifically the Minister for Education to be a part of this initiative to improve our students&#39; IT knowledge as we move from local to global advancements in our educational system. </p><p> <strong>Hannah Dovey  </strong><br />I completed a BSc (Hons) in Music Technology at Staffordshire University in 2001. After graduating, I worked in numerous media/post production companies. Then out of the blue, I landed myself a job as a part-time lecturer in University of Glamorgan, teaching Music Technology, Multimedia &amp; website design modules for 2 years. During my last year at Glamorgan (2003-2004)I undertook an MSc in E-Learning, in which I achieved a distinction. I have since moved on from the university, and I am currently working for a charity, Gwent Association of Voluntary Organisations (GAVO), where I am their E-learning Champion.</p><p>  <strong>Dulce Franco  </strong><br />  I am a Teacher at Lusofona University, <a href="http://www.ulusofona.pt">http://www.ulusofona.pt</a>, in Sciences Education Course (ICT).
