<p><strong>END APRIL NEWSLETTER</strong></p>
<strong>A NEWSLETTER OR NOT?</strong> <br />Christina Preston, our esteemed leader, has pointed out that the MirandaNet newsletter not only goes out on MirandaLink but is also put up on the MirandaNet website.  Therefore should we still call it the Newsletter or rename it eletter, ezine, webzine, webbulletin?  Any ideas please?   Email to:fellowship at mirandanet.ac.uk <p> <strong>THREE NEW SCHOLARS</strong> <br />Please contact scholars if you have something in common.   They will welcome contact from members as they are not always able to come to meetings.</p><p>  <strong>Iain Checkland</strong> <br />Iain Checkland has recently been appointed to post of Head of ICT at King George V School, Kowloon, Hong Kong.  He starts in September 2003 and will be focussing on the development of KS3.  He was directed towards the MirandaNet Fellowship by Richard Robinson, a MirandaNet Scholar, who is also in Hong Kong at the present.</p><p>Sounds as if we might have a quorum for a Hong Kong MirandaNet soon.</p><p>  <strong>Andrew Thomas</strong> <br />Andrew tells us:<br />&ldquo;At present I am a teacher at Paignton Community &amp; Sports College in the Phys. Ed. Dept and a research student with Liverpool John Moores University.   As I live in Devon, I am using mainly e-mail tutorials to achieve this.  I hope to complete my part-time PhD in 2005.  For this research, I am looking at ICT in PE.  The first part of this project is to audit 500 schools in England to see what, where &amp; how ICT equipment is being used in PE &amp; to determine the level of competence with PE staff.  It will also examine attitudes by these teachers towards the use of such equipment.  Following this audit, I will identify areas of good practice, or rather areas where ICT is being used well &amp; will investigate the effects that ICT has (or not) on the teaching &amp; learning of PE.  From this I intend to draw models of good practice for PE departments to use &amp; integrate into the National Curriculum.  I have also just finished an article which I hope to have published in the British Journal of Teaching Physical Education, on &#39;Edutainment&#39; in PE &amp; how  delivery of lessons can be enhanced with such tools as ICT.&rdquo;</p><p>We wish Andrew well and look forward to hearing what happens next&hellip;</p><p>  <strong>Gary Cooke</strong> <br />Gary Cooke is at Harrow School and in 2001 he introduced a staff IT development programme, with his colleague Nick Marchant (Head of ICT), which this February won the Institute of IT Trainers Award for Education Contribution of the Year.<br /> <a href="http://www.iitt.org.uk/public/awards/awardsawardsindex.asp">http://www.iitt.org.uk/public/awards/awardsawardsindex.asp</a> <br />Well done Gary.  We are very interested to hear about what made the training so good and hope to keep our colleagues informed.</p><p> <strong>IWB PROMETHEAN</strong></p><p>  <strong><em>Sponsor announcements with a difference &ndash; congratulations in order</em></strong> <br />At the awards made at the Educational Resource Award Dinner, held last week in Birmingham in conjunction with the Education Show, Promethean, our partner won an award.

This project illustrates the type of work undertaken in The Learning Centre where ICT is used as a tool to enhance the learning experience.  In this case sound engineering software, available for free, is used to aid understanding and bring the poem alive.  </p><p>Click on the link <a href="http://www.thelearningcentre.org/casestudy_dulce.html">www.thelearningcentre.org/casestudy</a> <br />to see how the students build up layers of sound to paint an audio picture.
