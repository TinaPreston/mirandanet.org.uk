  <p>Hey ho and away we go into the last year of the 20th Century or the first 
    of the 21st - depending on your view point.</p>
  <p>Many of us were at BETT and either watched or took part in the opening Keynote 
    Address. As a partaker I can assure everyone it was mega bowel churning but 
    I would not have missed it for the world!</p>
  <h3><a name="Jane"></a>Jane's Bit</h3>
  <h4>New on the MirandaNet Site</h4>
  <p>January saw a major site update so the text parallels what is in the new 
    brochure with its new logo and branding. Many pages have changed, but the 
    ones that will interest Fellows and Scholars are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li class="links">The new listing with links to your profiles and case study 
      work. Is yours there and has it got your latest case studies and information 
      linked. Check your entry at <a href="../fellowship/listing.php.html">www.mirandanet.org.uk/fellowship/listing.php</a> 
      and email the editor at MirandaNet if not.</li>
    <li class="links">The BETT Keynote Address - transcripts online at <a href="../publications/bett_innovat.htm">mirandanet.org.uk/publications/bett_innovat.htm</a> 
      and there are more reports on Scoop (see the stickies on the MirandaNet 
      community page).</li>
    <li class="links">If you didn't come to BETT, you will not have the new press 
      pack. Despair not, it's all at <a href="#">www.mirandanet.org.uk/publications/presspack.htm</a> 
      though not as beautfully laid out as the real thing</li>
    <li class="links">The Compaq Expert Mentoring Service which is in development 
      at the moment, but you can see the thinking at <a href="#">www.mirandanet.org.uk/feedback.htm</a></li>
    <li class="links">Notes on online copyright - an article written for the Scoop 
      Early Adopters mirandanet.org.uk/Scoop/copyright.htm</li>
    <li class="links">January's new links - including the nominations at BETT 
      for learning resources. <a href="../resources/linksnew.htm">www.mirandanet.org.uk/links/newlinks.htm</a></li>
    <li class="links">Diary 2000 - seminars for the year <a href="diary.php.html">www.mirandanet.org.uk/news/diary.php</a></li>
    <li class="links">And there's a new area called Industry Partners which replaces 
      what used to be the Discussion Zone (now taking place within Scoop). <a href="../associates/index.htm">www.mirandanet.org.uk/partners.htm</a></li>
    <li class="links">And as for new publications: Christina's list is onsite 
      with an order form to her book Teachers as Innovators <a href="../publications/preston.htm">www.mirandanet.org.uk/publications/preston.htm</a> 
      and then there's mine (which you all need to order for your libraries don't 
      you): 
      <p>The Internet: A Writer's Guide<br>
        ISBN 0 7136 5192 X<br>

    <li class="links">January <a name="MirandaRose"></a>MirandaRose Awards. The 
      Educational-site-of-the-Month has been awarded to Lee Manor Primary School 
      - maintained by a keen parent. Newly added sections include teacher topic

  <h3><a name="Giveaway"></a>The Great Computer Giveaway</h3>
  <p>In a moment of sublime madness I told Tina I would summarise the Mirandalink 
    thread on the subject of the &pound;500 subsidy for teachers who buy their 
    own machines. Well after some perusal of Mirandalink (and other sources) here 
    are my thoughts.</p>
  <p>First of all; it is not really &pound;500. It is <em>up to half the cost 
    of the machine or &pound;500 - whichever is lower.</em> In addition this includes 
    the VAT you will have to pay and finally the nice man from the Inland Revenue 
    will tax you on it as extra income. So, you buy a machine for &pound;750 plus 
    VAT - this brings you up to around &pound;1000. You receive &pound;500 in 
    a cheque from the nice man at the DfEE (don't expect return of post) and then 
    the inland revenue hit you for an extra &pound;110 of tax. So of your &pound;500 
    the Government has reclaimed &pound;250 in VAT and &pound;110 in tax. Aren't 
    they generous!</p>
  <p>Let us not be cavilling however as the project seems to have had the desired 
    effect - I know several teachers who have gone out to see if they can get 
    a computer who would never have done that in a million years in other circumstances.</p>
  <p>Secondly, the specification; I was extremely miffed to see the Riscos and 
    Linux were not offered as operating systems. Okay, people might not have chosen 
    them but the suspicion is that Uncle Bill has won again by default. The actual 
    hardware specification seems reasonable to me - it should last a complete 
    beginner about eighteen months before they feel the urge to upgrade! What 
    I am not happy about is the list of approved suppliers. It seems to me that 
    the Government may have a right to specify a technical standard but it is 
    a bit off when it restricts those who can take part in the bonanza. Those 
    who know me will know that I will have no truck with PC shops or companies 
    and get my computers built bespoke so to speak. I can guarantee quality and 
    service that way. My chap would have produced a fine machine to the specification 
    had I been able to ask him - and it would have had Linux on it as well! In 
    fact I asked him what he would charge for a specification the same as the 
    Viglen Contender. His reply was interesting. The 450 processor is no longer 
    made so he might have difficulty getting one and the smallest hard drive he 
    could source was 8.4gb (as against 6gb for the Viglen) however his machine 
    would meet the spec at &pound;850 inc Vat (compared to &pound;923.55). I can 
    vouch for the service and quality of this man's kit and also to his disbelief 
    when I quoted some of the suppliers to him. One in particular is universally 
    reviled for its dire service record. He queried how on Earth they could get 
    into what he described as a government sponsored cartel.</p>
  <p>So, there are some questions to be answered about how the scheme was set 
    up but if I say Sue Heightman and I know the depth of feeling evinced by Toshiba 
    executives about at least one of the participants then maybe it becomes clearer...</p>
  <p>If you do decide to buy a machine using the scheme there seems to be a clear 
    consensus that you avoid Time computers. I would also query the wisdom of 
    a BT machine since they do not make computers (erhh some mistake surely? No, 
    honest) and I would have reservations about RM but that is just sheer prejudice 
    based on experience. Otherwise, my vote goes as follows and for the following 
    reasons.</p>
  <p>Buy a Mac if you do not have to worry about PC compatibility and you are 
    rich.</p>
  <p>Buy a Tiny if you like the spec (good) and they might not mind delivering 
    it direct to your friend. (Based on a conversation)</p>
  <p>Buy a Fujitsu if you want a computer built like a panzer.</p>
  <p>Otherwise buy the best monitor (ie biggest) you can get.</p>
  <p>Do not consider any of the laptops as the prices are stupid - wait till the 
    Government caves into the TES campaign and they give you one anyway. </p>
  <p><a href="http://cft.ngfl.gov.uk/">cft.ngfl.gov.uk</a> is where you can find 
    all the details.</p>
  <h3><a name="Lurkers"></a>Lurkers</h3>
  <p>Another interesting run of messages on Mirandalink has been the Lurkers debate. 
    There seems to be an opinion emerging that lurking is a useful activity in 
    itself and as a long time lurker on the senco forum I would agree with this. 
    The point is also made that lurkers often talk meat to meat about their communities 
    resulting in new members appearing. I think Tina should delegate the task 
    of analysing and writing up this topic to some one with plenty of time on 
    their hands so that it gets published more widely (THES?) Just so long as 
    she doesn't delegate it to me!</p>
