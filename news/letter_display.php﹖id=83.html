<p><strong>MirandaNet Newsletter New Members March 2010</strong></p>
<h2>March New Members</h2> <p>I&#39;m catching up with new members following my trip to the US,  Australia, New Zealand&nbsp; and Japan. More on that in the next newsletter.</p> <p>Joining us we again have scholars and  members with an interesting  range of talents and interests. Susie Andretta is an  academic who has  written several books about information literacy and  transliteracy and  she edits the Journal of Information Literacy (<a href="http://ojs.lboro.ac.uk/ojs/index.php/JIL/index" title="http://ojs.lboro.ac.uk/ojs/index.php/JIL/index">http://ojs.lboro.ac.uk/ojs/index.php/JIL/index</a>).  Niall Mac Uidhilin who works for the National University of Ireland,  Galway,  has a similar challenge teaching ICT topics through the medium  of Irish in an  outreach centre in Connemara which is the strongest  Irish-speaking region in  Ireland. Mauri Kaipainen is professor of media  technology at S&ouml;dert&ouml;rn University (Sweden). Derek Glover is also now  an academic but he says &ldquo;My heart  is still in the classroom and I enjoy  my weekly visit to our local primary which  makes superb use of  technology&rdquo;.</p> <p>Matthew Bean, a teacher, has a background in art and design and wants  to talk to people with an interest in  visual literacy. Katherine  McCormack is a primary school teacher in the  Northern suburbs of Sydney  with enthusiasm for IWBs. Nick Tester has migrated to  Western  Australia from being an ICT coordinator in the UK and is now planning to   train firefighters using ICT not only to all geographical areas within  an area  close to the size of Europe, but also in remote indigenous   communities.</p> <p>We are also delighted to welcome many members from the  Beacon House School System (<a href="http://www.beaconhouse.edu.pk/">www.beaconhouse.edu.pk</a>).  They are particularly welcome in terms of World Ecitizenship  (<a href="https://wec.mirandanet.org.uk/">wec.mirandanet.org.uk</a>). We hope they will contribute to this website and that  we can consider some joint projects.</p> <p>Please get in touch directly with these  new scholars and members if you have a particular interest to share.</p> <p>Christina Preston</p> <h3>Scholars</h3> <p><strong>Susie Andretta</strong><a href="mailto:s.andretta@londonmet.ac.uk"></a></p> <p>Susie&#39;s research interests are information literacy and  transliteracy. Her publication profile includes a book on Information  literacy: a practitioner&#39;s guide (2005) which promotes this practice as a  foundation of independent and lifelong learning, and explores its  empowering effect on the facilitator and the learner. In 2007 she has  edited a book on Change and challenge: Information literacy for the 21st  Century which covers the implementation of information literacy  education from a range of UK-based and international perspectives. Susie  is currently working as the editor of the Journal of Information  Literacy (<a href="http://ojs.lboro.ac.uk/ojs/index.php/JIL/index">http://ojs.lboro.ac.uk/ojs/index.php/JIL/index</a>).  Her interest about Transliteracy, or the ability to create and  communicate information using a variety of media, stems from her work on  the impact of Web 2.0 technologies on participative learning.  Additional research interests include the impact of visual information  literacy (e.g. concept mapping) on the process of knowledge construction  and dissemination.</p> <p><strong>Matthew Bean</strong><a href="mailto:matthewbean570@btinternet.com"></a></p> <p>I have a background in art and design. I became interested in the  role of (new) technologies in creating novel forms of expression through  explorations of the work of Moholy Nagy with art students. This  eventually led to the use of digital technologies to make film and sound  installations. I now seek to integrate traditional studio media with  these digital technologies, understanding all tools as valid and  available to artists and crafts workers of all kinds. Recognition of  this work resulted in taking on the role of Head of ICT (in addition to  remaining Head of Art) at Bedford High School for Girls. This position  allows me to explore notions concerning collaborative practice through  online communities, wikis and blogs and recognise that digital  technologies may help teachers create, together with their students, the  conditions under which critical consciousness is developed that enables  students to become transformers of the world - the world that they  create for themselves. I recognise the importance of the visual in  navigating the digital world and wonder whether my profile/background is  dis/similar to others holding similar school positions?</p> <p><strong>Derek Glover</strong><a href="mailto:derek@derekglover.co.uk"></a></p> <p>I have been involved in interactive whiteboard research since 1997 as  one of the Keel IWB research team. I am also associated with Warwick  University and the London Institute of Education in a number of research  projects and in distance learning programmes. By training a geographer  and economist, I was head of Burford School Oxfordshire for 20 years and  then moved into higher education. My heart is still in the classroom  and I enjoy my weekly visit to our local primary which makes superb use  of technology.</p> <p><strong>Jennifer Groff</strong><a href="mailto:jen.groff@futurelab.org.uk"></a></p> <p>My  background and passion is innovating in education...rethinking,   reinventing and redesigning how children learn, particularly by   leveraging innovative technologies. I am currently a Fulbright Scholar   researching at Futurelab on the barriers to innovation in education and   how we can structure-in innovation and innovating into our education   systems and practices.</p> <p><strong>Mauri Kaipainen</strong><a href="mailto:mauri.kaipainen@sh.se"></a></p> <p>Mauri Kaipainen is professor of media technology at S&ouml;dert&ouml;rn  University (Sweden). He studied education, musicology and cognitive  science at the University of Helsinki and earned his PhD in 1994 on a  computational model of music cognition. His current research agenda  focuses on the concept of explorable multi-perspective media, based on  ontospaces, spatially defined ontologies. The ontospace  conceptualization has a range of applications in media art, community  and collaborative media applications, generative narrative systems and  learning environments with collaborative knowledge building.</p> <p><strong>Katherine McCormack</strong><a href="mailto:katherine.mccormack@det.nsw.edu.au"></a></p> <p>My name is Katherine McCormack and I am a primary school teacher in  the Northern suburbs of Sydney. I work closely with the staff at my  school in developing resources to integrate technology into the  classroom and I am a point of contact for technical support. I am  currently studying a Masters in Education - ICT Education. My current  project for my Masters is about studying the role of interactive  whiteboards in education with a focus on teacher perception and the need  for further professional development. It is through this study that I  came upon MirandaNet.</p> <p><strong>Nick Tester</strong><a href="mailto:nicktester@iinet.net.au"></a></p> <p>Following an IT career I entered teaching as a mature graduate,  becoming ICT coordinator at a secondary school. In 1998 I joined an EAZ  as IT subject specialist and e-learning manager. I specialised in the  support and development of interactive electronic whiteboards across the  curriculum, one of the first major implementations of IWs at that time.  The success of the EAZ e-learning program prompted many of our schools  to purchase additional boards. In addition I supported many ICT programs  including laptops in schools and video cameras. On completion of our  (extended) EAZ program I migrated to Western Australia in 2003 and  tutored (ICT) adults with intellectual disabilities. The aims were to  develop basic IT and life skills, socialisation and preparation for  re-entry to the work force. All the time I was learning new  methodologies and approaches to ICT development in adult education.</p> <p>Moving on I became curriculum developer for the WA Fire service  (FESA), developing specialised training courses for firefighters,  (shortly after moving to WA I became a volunteer firefighter with a  local bushfire brigade). I researched adult training methods and started  the process of moving our training delivery to a blended model,  combining class-room, e-learning, distance learning, mentoring and new  ideas for content presentation. Introducing such changes within a  Government organisation steeped in tradition was not easy.</p> <p>I am now the Manager of Emergency Management Training and Development  within FESA, and now have the authority to really introduce new ideas. I  am currently reviewing and rewriting all of our courses and curriculum,  and will be able to push forward with using technology and new  methodologies to deliver training throughout the State. It is difficult,  even if you live here, to gauge the scale of WA, and we need to deliver  training not only to all geographical areas within an area close to the  size of Europe, in addition to training local government officers and  emergency service providers, we also train in remote indigenous  communities. This raises issues of completely new training approaches  and physical training materials; I look forward to increasing the use of  ICT in all areas of our training and development activities.</p> <p><strong>Niall Mac Uidhilin</strong><a href="mailto:niall.macuidhilin@oegaillimh.ie"></a></p> <p>I work for the National University of Ireland, Galway teaching ICT  topics through the medium of Irish in an outreach centre in Connemara  which is the strongest Irish-speaking region in Ireland. I am working on  my PhD looking at innovative ways to use ICT to support learning  through the medium of Irish. The Irish-speaking regions of Ireland are  geographically dispersed and I believe that the formation of online  communities of learners could help reinforce a unique cultural and  linguistic heritage that is in grave danger of being lost.</p> <h3>Members</h3> <p><strong>Nazia Adee</strong><a href="mailto:nazia_adeel@hotmail.com"></a></p> <p>I have been learning to use ICT to achieve my learning objectives and  encourage greater student autonomy for the past three years.</p> <p><strong>Seema Adil</strong><a href="mailto:burney3223@yahoo.com"></a></p> <p>I join teaching with ICT as it covers almost every area of learning and teaching.</p> <p><strong>Pireha Ali</strong><a href="mailto:pireha_mushtaq@hotmail.com"></a></p> <p>I am Pireha Mushtaq Ali from Pakistan. I am into teaching profession  from 9 years. Teaching for me is one kind of a job in which I am able to  see progression in my own teaching and pupils&#39; learning. With the use  of ICT, I am able to achieve those objectives which I am not able to  achieve in a traditional classroom. ICT makes my classroom interactive  and could see beyond the four walls of the classroom.</p> <p><strong>Musarat Anjum</strong><a href="mailto:musarat.anjum@gmail.com"></a></p> <p>I am a Science teacher in Beaconhouse School System.
