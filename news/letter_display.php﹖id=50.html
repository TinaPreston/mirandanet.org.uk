<p><strong><b>July MirandaNet Newsletter</b></strong></p>
<strong>Basia Korczak Award - Mechelle De Craene </strong><p>  Many of you will remember Basia Korczak, a MirandaNet Fellow, who died in her forties of cancer. She was a creative practitioner whose work also demonstrated her sense of humour. In her memory we started an award for practitioners who demonstrate the same creative and imaginative approaches in deploying digital technologies in teaching and learning. This year the award has been won by Mechelle De Craene from Florida.</p><p>  <strong>Tampa Teacher Named One of the Most Innovative Education Leaders in the US</strong></p><p>  Mechelle De Craene, a special education and gifted education teacher at James Buchanan Middle School in Hillsborough County, was recently honoured with the Cable&rsquo;s Leaders in Learning Award for creating and implementing innovative ways to educate students and for making a substantial contribution to learning.</p><p>  An initiative created and administered by Cable in the Classroom, the cable industry&#39;s education foundation, Cable&#39;s Leaders in Learning Awards recognize highly inventive classroom educators, administrators, community leaders, and policymakers who are transforming education from kindergarten through high school (K-12).</p><p>  As one of four winners nationwide in the General Excellence category, De Craene is being recognized for developing Very Special Techies, a project that encourages media literacy through multimodal learning opportunities for students with special needs. In addition to using media to aid in class instruction, De Craene started a class blog, which serves as a virtual peer support group for her special needs students, who are all considered at-risk.</p><p>  <a href="http://www.fldoe.org/successstories/2007/06-08.asp">Here is the link.</a></p><p>  <a href="http://leadersinlearning.blogspot.com/2007/06/mechelle-de-craene-special-education.html">Here is Mechelle&rsquo;s podcast for Cable in the Classroom Leaders in Learning.</a>  She says she was a bit nervous at first, but tried her best. </p><p>  And <a href="http://lpcesc07.ning.com/">here is the LPCE website that Mechelle made. </a>  We will be interviewing Mechelle about her approach to teaching and learning in the summer. </p><p>  <strong>New MirandaNet Award - Senior Work-based Research Fellows</strong></p><p>  We have many Fellows who continue voluntarily to make a significant contribution to the knowledge of our community of practice after they have submitted their first Fellowship article (2,000 or multimodal equivalent &ndash; do be inventive here, blog? Video? Visual narrative?)</p><p>  We are now celebrating the expert support of these members with a new title, Senior Work-based Research Fellow.  If you would like to nominate yourself or a colleague for this further award please get in touch with me.  We will interview you about the leading work you are engaged in. This interview takes place in the forum over about a fortnight which give you time to gather your thoughts.  Illustrations are welcome. These interviews provide an important insight into what our leading practitioners are doing now&hellip;do come forward. </p><p>  Michael Smith and Lawrence Williams have received our first awards of this title for their innovative work in Visual Learning. You will find both the interviews in the <a href="../visual/index.html">Visual Learning knowledge base.</a> The first stage of this is almost complete. Your contributions are welcome. </p><p>  <a href="../visual/seminar.htm">Podcasts of the &#39;Multimodal Concept Mapping and Visual Learning&#39; seminar can be found here.</a></p><p>  Christina Preston</p><p>   <strong>My first encounter with a computer</strong><br /> Personal reflections on digital technology<br /> 1950s to 2000s </p><p>  Stories about the ways in which computers have impinged on my life since the 1950s have been serialised in the journal of our sister &#39;community of practice&#39;, ITTE. Several of these teacher educators have told me that these stories remind them of some of their experiences too. So I thought MirandaNet members might like to read them as well. </p><p>  <a href="../ftp/first_encounter.doc">The first episode</a> is about my encounter with what looked like a large metal wardrobe with whirring eyes when I was about six. My father was one of the first data-processing managers at a bank in the City of London in the 1950s, and I thought these problematic computers kept him away from home too much...</p><p>  Do you have any similar experiences to add from your childhood encounters with computers? Send them to me please.<br /> Christina Preston</p><p>  <strong>The latest research by MirandaNet Fellows on Braided Learning</strong></p><p>  The latest research by MirandaNet Fellows, Braided Learning, is about how an e-mature community of practice is learning online. There is a report on the Guardian website:</p><p>  Nightingale, J. Research: Education without complications, Guardian, Link Supplement June 14th, London</p><p>  <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/elearning/story/0,,2105790,00.html">This link has Research extra<br /> IT training | Mobile access in Kenya | Personalised learning</a></p><p>  <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/elearning/story/0,,2104240,00.html">This link is about the Naace/Itte/MirandaNet CoPs research.</a></p><p>  Email me for more details about this research which is to be published soon.</p><p>  Braided Learning Presentation at Leicester University<br /> Braided Learning: Salmon&#39;s Sixth Step?<br /> Presentation made on 23 April 2007. The full presentation with the soundtrack and notes are <a href="http://www.le.ac.uk/beyonddistance/events/pastevents.html">available here.</a></p><p>  If you are interested in this subject I am just beginning a discussion in the <a href="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/phorum/list.php?33">MirandaNet forum </a>called Braided Learning. </p><p>  There&#39;s a reference at the top to the New Fellowship leaflet, which can be <a href="../ftp/fellows.pdf">downloaded from here.</a>  (320KB PDF)</p><p>  <strong>The Naace report update</strong></p><p>  Tuesday June 19, 2007 - EducationGuardian.co.uk<br /> The Guardian has covered our latest report into No improvement in IT training</p><p>  A few years ago, a report into the much-criticised teacher ICT training scheme funded by the New Opportunities Fund pinpointed a shortage of trained teacher educators and advisors as a key cause of the programme&#39;s failures. A new survey, funded by the Institute of Education&#39;s centre for excellence in work-based learning and produced by MirandaNet, suggests the problem remains. Of some 150 members of ICT specialist groups Naace, the Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education (ITTE) and MirandaNet polled, around a third had had no ICT training for three years and 10% had never had any formal instruction.</p><p>  Naace members identified learning platforms as the priority area for ICT continued professional development needs, while MirandaNet and ITTE members highlighted practice-based courses and applied research. All three groups saw developing communities of practice as important.</p><p>  <a href="http://www.wlecentre.ac.uk/">The summary is published here.</a></p><p>  You will find our draft copies of the report linked from the items on the <a href="../home.php.html">MirandaNet Home Page. </a></p><p>  <strong>Evaluation of the ICT Test Bed project </strong></p><p>  The final reports from the Evaluation of the ICT Test Bed project are now available which members will find very useful in making the case for digital technologies. There were two research teams evaluating this important DfES-funded project and they were led by MirandaNetters Prof Bridget Somekh at Manchester Metropolitan University and Prof Jean Underwood at Nottingham Trent University.</p><p>  The project undertook work on ICT implementation in three ICT Test Bed areas of social disadvantage. Two of these were within inner cities and one was in a rural area. The 28 ICT Test Bed Schools and departments in three colleges had access to high levels of ICT hardware and appropriate software, as well as support to make the most effective use of this investment.</p><p>  Key findings from the research include:</p><p>  - As technology was embedded, schools&#39; national test outcomes improved beyond expectations.</p><p>  - Institutions that were more e-mature improved their performance levels significantly more quickly than those that were not. However, there was a dip in performance until the ICT became embedded and staff developed the requisite skills.</p><p>  - Effective use of ICT personalised learning by enabling greater learner choice within the curriculum, improved assessment for learning and more learner-directed teaching.</p><p>  - The use of electronic registration improved attendance levels in some schools by three to four per cent, while behaviour management systems were perceived to have a positive impact on both behaviour and attendance.</p><p>  - Where new technologies were introduced into all of a school&#39;s classrooms at the same time, a culture of sharing and mutual support developed as the whole staff faced the task of embedding the technology into their pedagogy.</p><p>  - ICT made it much easier to share assessment information with parents via school websites or learning platforms.</p><p>  The <a href="http://www.evaluation.icttestbed.org.uk/reports">final reports from the Evaluation of the ICT Test Bed project</a> are now available. </p><p>  If you would like any further information on the evaluation please contact Helen Aston.</p><p>  <strong>Global Citizenry</strong></p><p>Joe Nutt sends us this useful information which is relevant to World Ecitizens.</p><p>  I have just finished reading the publication <em>The Corruption of the Curriculum, </em>published by Civitas on Monday and thought members would be extremely interested in Alex Standish&rsquo;s essay, <em>Geography used to be about Maps.</em> It contains a well informed, insightful and thought-provoking analysis of global citizenship and how it relates to the curriculum. All the essays are the result of highly experienced teachers and excellent, but Standish&rsquo;s article will interest members most. <br /> <a href="http://www.civitas.org.uk/press/prcsCorruption.php">http://www.civitas.org.uk/press/prcsCorruption.php </a><br /> <a href="http://joenutt.squarespace.com/educational-research-and-news"></a>http://joenutt.squarespace.com/educational-research-and-news/ </p><p>   <strong>Out of Sight, Out of Mind</strong></p><p>  Stephen Heppell has also sent us some news about NotSchool.</p><p>  If you listened to UK&#39;s Radio 4 early-ish in the morning you might have heard Jean Johnson interviewed, sympathetically, about &lsquo;Out of Sight, Out of Mind&rsquo; - a paper from the Inclusion Trust about those many excluded from school by behaviour or circumstances. The paper was released this morning.</p><p>  I am proud to be chair of trustees of the Inclusion Trust charity. It&rsquo;s flagship project Notschool.net is for excluded students; many of you know of it. With some 1,000 children passing through annually we are making a huge difference to many lives, but the problem is significant and we are lobbying to expand the numbers that we are allowed to help, substantially. This will need your support &ndash; the best possible support is widespread advocacy - if you can speak up for Notschool.net, anywhere, it helps a lot.</p><p>  For now, <a href="http://rubble.heppell.net/media_forum/OutOfSight.pdf"> the paper can be found here</a> and the Inclusion Trust - with more details of <a href="http://www.inclusiontrust.org/">Notschool.net &ndash; here.</a></p><p>  <strong>Games Are Good For Learning...But Not Just Because They Are Games</strong></p><p>  Drew Buddie recommends James Gee&rsquo;s take on games in education:</p><p>  Mediasite presentation entitled: Games Are Good For Learning...But Not Just Because They Are Games is a pod cast of James Gee&rsquo;s Keynote presentation at What Do Games Teach Us About Learning Conference 17th August 2006. This is the summary:</p><p>  What Video Games have to Teach us About Learning and Literacy </p><p>  Good computer and video games are learning machines. Despite being long and complex, they get themselves learned and learned well, not just in tutorials, but as part and parcel of playing the game to the end. Thus, designers face and largely solve an intriguing educational dilemma, one also faced by schools and workplaces, as well: how to get people to learn and master something that is long and challenging - and enjoy it.</p><p>  Schools, workplaces, families, and academic researchers have a lot to learn about learning from good computer and video games. In this talk I will explicate the learning principles that are built into good video games and discuss their implications for learning in and out of schools for a global, high-tech, and risky world.</p><p>  Date: Thursday, August 17, 2006<br /> Time: 9:30 am<br /> Duration: 1:22:34<br /> <a href="http://mediasite.eq.edu.au/mediasite/viewer/?peid=564ac4fe-67aa-4278-b583-d794eef31dd1">Link here.</a></p><p>  <strong>MirandaNet Evaluation for TAG Learning</strong></p><p>  MirandaNet members will be aware of the support that <a href="http://www.taglearning.com/">TAG Learning</a> has given MirandaNet during the past few years: they are the UK distributors for Inspiration, and have supplied copies of the program for those of you who have been part of the project. TAG also distribute Digital Blue, which MirandaNet members used during the recent World Ecitizens conference in Prague earlier this year.</p><p>  TAG Learning asked MirandaNet to work with them in evaluating <a href="http://www.taglearning.com/productdetails/MAPS+Managed+ePortfolios.html">MAPS, their managed ePortfolios.</a><a href="../profdev/tagmaps.htm">online questionnaires. </a><br /> You can also contact me john.cuthell at mirandanet.ac.uk</p><p>  <strong>The iTeach Tutor Bank &amp; Student Recruitment</strong></p><p>   Georgina Stein, based at the Faculty of Education, Canterbury Christ Church University and a member of MirandaNet, is the Project Manager, of an innovative course online called iTeach.</p><p>  Here is the information for potential students who are planning to teach in England in the shortage areas:</p><p>  <a href="http://www.iteach.ac.uk/">iTeach </a>is a partnership between Canterbury Christ Church University in the United Kingdom and Hibernia College in Ireland.  iTeach delivers &#39;online initial teacher education&#39; to students across England who wish to pursue a convenient route to becoming a qualified teacher.

Congratulations Ian.</p><p>  <strong>New Scholars</strong></p><p>  <strong>Noel Chidwick </strong></p><p>   I have been heavily involved in the use of ICT in teaching and learning ever since 1997 when I developed the first Scottish FE online learning environment, Scotland&#39;s Virtual College, (using FirstClass). </p><p>  Since then I have worked as an ICT in education advisor at SCET (now LTScotland) where I organised events and conferences and also ran many workshops and seminars for teachers and lecturers in the use of ICT in education. </p><p>  I have also been seconded to SFEU where I developed one of the first online courses about online learning, and again organised a number of events in the area. </p><p>  I am now a founding partner in the New Curiosity Shop, a venture which provides online courses in a range of subjects, and which also provides consultancy services (Moodle is a current popular request). I also talk on the subject, and am involved in the highly regarded <a href="http://www.rsc-ne-scotland.ac.uk/eolympics/">&#39;e-olympics&#39;,</a> where I contribute a presentation and act as a judge. </p><p>  <strong>Karen Church </strong></p><p>   I am currently the Program Manager, Leadership and Learning Technologies at the South Australian Department of Education and Children&rsquo;s Services. I work with Principals, directors and leaders across the state, providing them with specific advice, strategies and professional learning opportunities in relation to ICT. I also manage the SA <em>Masterclass </em>program &ndash; where identified national and international speakers are brought to SA to share their best practice with educators. </p><p>  I have a particular interest in online learning and have worked extensively with; Centra Symposium (virtual classroom); Learning Management Systems such as Janison; and Video Conferencing.</p><p>   I am a World of Warcraft addict (67 Priest, 46 Druid, 36 Mage, 19 Twink Hunter) and have recently begun online courses in SecondLife (University of Southern Queensland) and Quest Atlantis. </p><p>  <strong>Joel Galbraith</strong></p><p>   I have a BA in Film and Media Arts (BYU) and an MS in Technology Teacher Education (BYU). For that matter, I also earned an AAS in Photography (Ricks College) many moons ago. I am currently completing a PhD degree at Penn State University in Instructional Systems. Prior to returning to school full-time to pursue the PhD, I had worked for many years in higher education (at Brigham Young University) as an instructional designer and technologist, consulting with faculty on the design of their online and blended courses. I also led numerous design teams to create various multimedia learning objects to support teaching and learning. </p><p>  I have helped design multiple online university courses, and have designed, delivered and revised my own online and blended courses. I am keenly interested in the role of technology in education. I am concerned about the new &quot;digital divide&quot; and what has been further characterized as a division between the connected and un-connected. The increasing numbers of the &quot;Net-Generation&quot; and &quot;digital natives&quot; enrolling in our schools will demand a very different experience than many of us are used to providing or supporting. I am fascinated with the opportunities presented by web2.0 applications but am frankly equally fearful of where this is all leading. I am convinced the changes will be profound over the next few years and that the change will come swiftly and catch many by surprise--particularly in the field of education. While I feel I&#39;m already behind the early adopters, I&#39;m working hard to get up to speed--keeping a blog, posting pictures, contributing to wikis, generating my own content, participating in second life, and introducing much of this into my own teaching. </p><p>  I&#39;m learning to relinquish control over what is learned, when it is learned, how it is learned and who the expert is supposed to be. It is admittedly a difficult process, but I&#39;m thoroughly enjoying being a learner again myself.</p><p>  <strong>David Gorton </strong></p><p>   As a Physical Education leader, I believe that it is paramount that all teaching &amp; learning opportunities are developed, especially in a subject area that has traditionally not embraced ICT. </p><p>   With the emergence of differing approaches to Sport Science at Degree, FE &amp; KS3/4, the opportunities to integrate ICT into a PE lesson, rather than a &lsquo;bolt on&rsquo;, resources can now be sourced from a number of comprehensive websites such as Brianmac, TES and Brunts School. </p><p>  Whilst many professionals have shared resources via ebay, I believe that there is a need for collaborative development of a variety of documents and videos. Since the adoption of youtube as a tool I have been able to prepare a number of KS4 &lsquo;starter&rsquo; videos for GCSE PE (Edexcel). Since &lsquo;posting&rsquo; other videos are now appearing, thus developing a thriving &lsquo;community&rsquo; of video developers in Physical Education (Potential Podcasts...). </p><p>  Upon developing the curriculum at Westminster Academy, accompanied by an e-learning resource library, the &lsquo;business &amp; enterprise&rsquo; Academy now has a unique opportunity to lead the way in resource sharing in Physical Education.....</p><p>    Why re-invent the wheel? </p><p>  <strong>Rupert Higham </strong>(aka Rumaki Heron in SL), University of Exeter </p><p>   I am about to start a 4-year PhD course on the possibilities of more democratic, dialogue-based learning via ICT, and with a focus on VL (Virtual Life) and MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) technologies. I am also investigating the possibility of delivering a 2nd-year undergraduate course via Second Life. I am still a relative novice in the field, and am looking to learn as much as I can about innovative forms of online educational practice. </p><p>   For the past 3 years I have been a high-school teacher on the Isle of Wight, and have major reservations about direction of mainstream education. My previous research on this came from an anthropological perspective. I have seen first-hand the dramatic difference in motivation and possibility afforded by offering students access to innovative ICT equipment, programs and environments, and am passionate about its possibilities to afford them opportunities to take control of their learning, and communicate directly with those who share their interests. I see VL as having the capability to help break down the boundaries between educational institutions and wider society, and to promote active global communities of interest.</p><p>   <strong>Theo Kuechel</strong></p><p>   My time at Art School, Carlisle 1966-68, and Hornsey College of Art 1968-73 has been had the greatest influence in my life, and still underpins my philosophy and practice in my work in education and creativity. </p><p>  I taught Art and Design &amp; Technology in schools for 15 years before becoming and Adviser for ICT with Bradford Education Authority, remaining in post for five years. I left the Bradford LEA to work in the creative IT industry for the next four years developing multimedia skills and providing consultancy and training in professional graphics, design and media software. </p><p>  My current role is that of an independent digital media and learning technologies consultant. I associate closely with the University of Hull, developing digital media projects and courses. I work closely with K.J Burden, (Director Cascade Multimedia - University of Hull) producing evaluations and reports including the BECTA, Teaching and Learning with DV Assets, and a Nesta funded action research project New Directions in Digital Media. I am currently working with University on a JISC funded project delivering pedagogical packages for the ITN Newsfilm Online archive. </p><p>  My personal research interests include all areas of educational technology, Web 2.0, collaborative learning around the world and the use of digital video for learning and the role of user generated content for learning. </p><p>  <strong>Rachel Lawrence </strong></p><p>   Co-founder and company director with the Edujam CiC Community Interest Company. Author of Naace - Primary Focus on personalising learning.</p><p>  <strong>Karen Mulitalo </strong></p><p>   I am currently developing online clinical curriculum for physician assistant students. I have particular interest in how online collaborative learning affects attitudes of students from diverse background. I would like to participate in discussions regarding not only the teaching of principles related to sound clinical decision making, but how outcomes for these new methods can be determined.</p><p>  <strong>Prue Salter </strong></p><p>   After working as a secondary high school teacher (in Australia and Asia), I now run an educational consulting business that specialises in helping high school students develop their study and learning skills. I run sessions for students, parents and teachers, write resources for teachers to use with students and have recently released a subscription based online study skills handbook. I am interested in how I can incorporate technology effectively, particularly with respect to this online learning experience I have created for students to interact with. As part of my current Master of Education work I am interested in pursing research in the area of the extent to which adolescents use technology outside of the classroom to prepare for tests and examinations.</p><p>  <strong>Patricia Skilbeck </strong></p><p>   As a teacher, I feel privileged to be able to use my background in psychology and behavioural sciences to help children move forward in their learning. The parts of my role that inspire me most are to do with motivation, achievement and finding ways to enable children to understand themselves more deeply and also to help them develop the feelings that are associated with being part of a rich and productive community. My interest in ICT was initially tentative and I felt some alienation towards the whole thing partly due to IT shaman I came across who seemed to have an aptitude for compounding my own feelings of inadequacy due to their inability to go at a speed I could keep up with or to their own limited knowledge which made it difficult for them to explain things clearly enough for me to follow. Okay, I know it&#39;s not fair to blame them for my own slowness! Gradually, even reluctantly, I began to see that new technologies dovetailed perfectly with the things I&#39;m most excited about. With newly opened eyes, my interest has snowballed and I&#39;m now hungry and actively searching out new developments and am very keen to further my understanding and skills. The intersection of ICT, psychology and education undoubtedly offers the potential to transform learning as we know it.</p><p>  <strong>Carol Weale </strong></p><p>   I have been using ICT in education for over 20 years and now spread my ideas and practice as a Leading Teacher. My MA (Ed) was concerned with strategies for teaching higher thinking skills and that is where I saw the most obvious application of ICT apart from the motivational aspect. Part of my advisory work is leading workshops where I show the application of mind mapping in its various forms and its versatility. One of the areas that I pioneered in the 1990s was the use of websites for virtual learning/revision/sharing/teaching and I was possibly best known for my Shakespeare Classroom site which was popular worldwide.</p><p>  <strong>John Woollard</strong></p><p>   I am a lecturer in information technology education at the School of Education, University of Southampton where I completed my PhD in pedagogy and the teaching of computers with metaphors. I coordinate the PGCE for IT teachers and contribute to the MSc and MA(Ed) programmes for teachers and trainers in computer based learning. I also teach a research methods course and have developed many on-line resources to support elearning and blended teaching.</p><p>  <strong>Project Manager</strong></p><p>  <strong>Richard Philips</strong></p><p>   As Business Development Director I am actively looking at ways that MirandaNet can actively grow and flourish to the benefits of all its members and fellows. </p><p>  <strong>New Member</strong></p><p>  <strong>Josef Bicik</strong></p><p>  Trying to do my best to push things further. </p>
