<p><strong><b>June Mirandanet Newsletter</b></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why did you call your professional experience of Visual Learning an Inspirational Journey, Michael?</strong> Michael Smith, who is in charge of the ICT CPD programmes at his school, gave an inspiring talk about his professional journey in Visual Learning at the Naace conference in February 2007.</p>
<p>Michael has been developing these ideas over time as the chair of our multimodal mapping workshops which have been funded by Inspiration.  We have been grateful to Inspiration for providing this space for group reflection face to face about issues in learning which are becoming more pressing in the classroom.</p>
<p>We are now using the forum format to develop his ideas in an interview.  Readers&rsquo; comments will be very welcome at any point as this discussion unfolds over the next month.</p>
<p>So my first question is, <br /> Why did you call your professional experience of Visual Learning an Inspirational Journey, Michael?</p>
<p>You can find the beginning of the interview <a href="../visual/inspiration_journey.htm"> here</a> as well as a preview of other questions that Michael is going to answer.</p>
<p>You can follow the <a href="../visual/index.html">interview as it unfolds and comment as well here. </a> Do not forget to log in if you want to comment.  If you tick the box you will be informed when other people post in that forum thread.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Literacy forum</strong></p>
<p>The interview with Michael Smith is one of the activities in the Visual Learning web forum which we hope MirandaNetters will talk about their work and ask questions. In this way we are trying to build an interactive and current knowledge base in which practitioners&rsquo; views are recorded as they develop.</p>
<p>These are the strands in the forum that we have started:</p>
<p>Display technologies: John Cuthell<br /> Creating resources designed for visual learning: Jane Finch<br /> The interactive web in Visual Learning: Theo Keuchel<br /> Images in Visual Learning: Theo Keuchel<br /> Communicating visually through animation: John Cuthell<br /> Visualising Data: Christina Preston<br /> Creating Maps of ideas: Michael Smith and Nigel Riley<br /> Games in Visual Learning: John Cuthell<br /> Visual Narratives: Christina Preston</p>
<p>- but we are not sure that we have the right strands or the right number of strands in this very new field. We welcome the comments of members who have anything to contribute even if it is just questions - if you have not entered a forum before this might be the time to try one out.</p>
<p>See you in there&hellip;..<br />

<p><strong>MirandaNet in the Guardian Links supplement <br /> Research round up </strong></p>
<p>From the Guardian Link supplement which will be published on Tuesday June 19th.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a busy time at MirandaNet. They have produced another report,funded by the Institute of Education's Centre for Excellence in Work-based Learning (WLE), investigating teachers', advisers' and teacher educators' professional development needs in ICT with 250 members of the IT specialist groups Naace and ITTE and MirandaNet.It found that around a third of the respondents had received no ICT training for three years and some ten per cent had never had any form of formal instruction. Practice-based training, rather than skills-based or academic courses, were deemed most useful by 41%. In terms of motives for using ICT, equipping learners to be independent featured prominently (48%) as did international collaborations (19%). Very few respondents made any link to supporting vocational learning &ndash; a key strand of the new 14-19 curriculum.</p>
<p>In terms of ICT CPD needed for the future, there was a split in opinion with Naace members identifying learning platforms as the priority while ITTE and MirandaNet members pinpointed a need for practice-based courses and applied Research&rdquo;. <br />Julie Nightingale</p>

<p>Sample the latest technology through hands-on workshops<br /> Have access to a range of practical advice and assistance<br /> See examples of how innovation and best practice is transforming education in schools across the region<br /> Discuss and debate topical issues</p>
<p>The conference will be held at: The Robinson Centre, Wyboston, Bedfordshire, MK44 3AR.</p>
<p><strong>Bebo at In the Wild conference</strong><br /> From Leon Cych   <a href="http://www.l4l.co.uk/">http://www.L4L.co.uk</a></p>
<p>At the recent 'In the Wild conference' about informal learning at Channel 4 - Rachel O'Connell, Chief Safety Officer, Beebo gave a talk about Beebo's policies and their links with government in new initiatives- this is excellently blogged by Ewan McIntosh who shared the stage with her.</p>
<p><a href="http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2007/05/41_minutes_per_.html">http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2007/05/41_minutes_per_.html</a></p>
<p>I would also like to draw people's attention to <a href="http://www.netcaucus.org/"> this video made at congress</a> recently about exactly what is happening on social networking sites or as much data as has been draw together from the world's experts on online crime against children so far - this is quantative and qualitative data that show certain trends and it might be surprising to some to see what actually does appear to be happening on these sites.</p>
<p>Watch the video and follow the links to the academic papers.  Now contrast that with <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5344722.stm"> a report like this</a></p>
<p>and then stand back and reflect. Our young people aren't stupid - in fact they are probably more savvy than their mentors in these areas despite having less 'life skills'.</p>
<p>To be able to unpick these issues we need to be able to get away from the "perceived" risks and concentrate on what is "actually" happening and work from there.</p>
<p>To be honest I'm more concerned with <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6359363.stm">the recent Unicef report</a> that purports to show how badly we are doing in terms of serving our children.</p>
<p><strong>Resources : Know IT All</strong></p>
<p>Schools can order bulk copies of a new resource from Childnet International to help parents promote positive and safe Internet use.</p>
<p>'Know IT All', an interactive CD-Rom commissioned by the DfES, will be available to all maintained schools in England to order in bulk quantity for parents free of charge.</p>
<p>A key aim of the CD-Rom is to encourage parents to have a dialogue with their children about the internet and there is special material produced by and for young people, and a special Activity Centre with quizzes and games that parents and children can play together. A summary of the advice on the CD-Rom has been translated into Arabic, Bengali, Gujarati, Polish, Mandarin, Punjabi, Urdu and British Sign Language and is presented in the latest multi-media video.<br /> <a href="http://tinyurl.com/28fdfd">http://tinyurl.com/28fdfd</a><br /> or<br /> <a href="http://publications.teachernet.gov.uk/default.aspx?PageFunction=productdetai">http://publications.teachernet.gov.uk/default.aspx?PageFunction=productdetai ls&amp;PageMode=spectrum&amp;ProductId=DFES-00308-2007&amp;</a></p>

<p><strong>Panorama programme on wi-fi</strong></p>
<p>Naace have reported on recent concerns expressed in the press culminated in a Panorama programme focussed upon the safety issues associated with wi-fi networks, particularly in schools. The programme was broadcast on Monday 21st May, and a subsequent discussion on the Naace AC mailing list proved most informative. As one might expect, the weight of opinion expressed in the mailings came down on the 'no danger' side of the debate, and several members provided the type of information and guidance which they were offering to their schools.</p>

<p><a href="http://freetheteacher.blogspot.com/"></a>Dughall sends us his newly created blog.     The theme is on the same lines as his presentation in Prague. Dughall would like to see technology used to assist early years practitioners in the gathering of evidence and reporting to parents and in the creation of an eportfolio/record of a learning journey.</p>
<p><strong>New Scholars</strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;Nigel Beacham</strong></p>
<p>Dr Nigel Beacham B.Sc, M.Sc, PhD, CEng, MBCS, CITP,CSci., Mathematics Education Centre, Loughborough University, UK.

He has a BSc in Computer Science, an MSc in Human Computer Interaction, and has completed a PhD on the subject of Distributed Performance Support Systems. He has published numerous papers about his research within international peer-reviewed journals and at conferences, and is a member of the British Computer Society.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Beckett</strong></p>
<p>I graduated in 2006 from Brighton University. I started my teaching career in East Sussex as a teacher of ICT in a secondary school. Whilst working in the school it became apparent that ICTs were not being used throughout the school due to a lack of teacher knowledge/understanding.</p>
<p>I have a great interest in education and the way in which ICTs can make an impact on education across the curriculum. With this interest in mind I have run several core professional development courses promoting the use of ICT in several curriculum areas.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Elliott</strong></p>
<p>I have worked in education for 27 years, mainly in the FE sector. Beginning in an Agricultural College in the early Eighties I quickly realised that I needed to be adaptable in order to maintain a career in this rapidly changing sector. Adaptability and the desire to keep ahead have served me well in my personal development as an educator, skilled in the use of ICT. More recently I became heavily involved with the roll out of an e-learning system at my college. This was (and remains) a significant transformation for staff, but one which I was well prepared for. As a Senior Lecturer with mentoring responsibilities I supported staff through the passage from traditional teacher to facilitator of learning using ICT.</p>
<p>I am not particularly interested in infrastructure and networks - they should just work shouldn't they? I prefer to focus more on the application of ICT solutions and on the breaking down of traditional barriers by the provision of support and the active sharing of good practice. The ultimate aim of any innovation in education must be to enhance learning in some way. This applies just as much for ICT as to other developments. My current role as a council officer allows me to support staff in local authority schools as they develop their ICT strategies and begin their journey with e-learning. Scotland is poised at the beginning of a major ICT project - Glow. This presents so many new possibilities for teachers, pupils and parents that it is difficult to imagine. But by the time you read this it will be a reality and we will be learning with it.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Moss</strong></p>
<p>I have been involved in ICT and Education since I qualified as a Teacher in 1990. I have worked in Science and ICT, and I was initially interested in the integration of ICT into the curriculum. I have been Head of ICT, an IT Manager in a school in Madrid and an ICT Consultant with the British Council. I am currently a Global Product Development Consultant with the British Council.  My interest is Mobile Learning and evolving learner autonomy and student driven individualisation of learning through the use of e-learning and e-materials. I am currently studying for an Ed. Doc in Education and my focus for my research will be related to my topics of interest.</p>
<p><strong>Kenneth Msiska</strong></p>
<p>I am a young Malawian who is fascinated by ICT developments. I am leading the Director of the Young Advocates for the Advancement of ICT-related Development (Y.A.A.ICT-D), a youth-led organization based in Malawi.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Perkins</strong></p>
<p>Originally a trained architect who fell into the world of teaching as a Design and Technology teacher. I returned to an early passion for computers and technology after a 15 year gap. Computer technology had moved on from the era of the ZX81 and the Spectrum (no more rubbery keys and 1K of memory) so far that after initially teaching mostly within the Design area I chose to specialise in ICT teaching and helping to integrate Technology use across all schools I have worked within.</p>
<p>I am at the moment participating in a distance learning Masters Degree course in the use of ICT in Education at Sunderland University specialising in the use of a myriad of web-tools to enhance and bring teaching and learning in line with students ideals and expectations. I firmly believe that the facilitation of blended environments in which the internet and technology becomes a tool to enhance and motivate teaching and learning, is important is a changing world of communication and work. Recent projects and research has included: <br /> <a href="http://www.constructict.com/cict">CICT Moodle </a>into Web 2.0 - Using a VLE in a way which extends the environment into a more flexible and read/write space. <br /> <a href="http://www.constructict.com/wiki">CICT TikiWiki </a>- Gnomes, Champions and Trolls - Using a wiki in a very traditional school to enhance students understanding of how to remix and research areas of technology and its effect on our lives, while not plagiarising or blindly copying. The use of roles and existing examples helped to illustrate how personalities work within such collaborative communities. <br /> <a href="http://www.constructict.com/studentblog">CreativICTism</a> - Weblogs and their wide variety of practical and empowering uses they can have within schools.  The French Connection - Using Social Networks to learn French within a school (in process.) <br /> After six years of International teaching in Egypt and Mexico, I am specifically interested in my return to the UK and how to continue to develop these technologies and collaboration across schools internationally to help students understand the effects of working in a global community in which problems can only be solved in a collaborative environment.</p>
<p><strong>Graham Stanley</strong></p>
<p>I am particularly interested in emerging technologies (blogs, wikis, podcasts, etc) and their use for language learning and teaching, and am currently project manager for the British Council project in Second Life (we are building a 3D self-access centre for teenagers there).</p>
