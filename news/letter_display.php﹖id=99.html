<p><strong>May 2011 Membership Roundup</strong></p>
<h2>Membership News</h2>
<h3>Resources for members</h3>
<p>The MirandaNet Fellowship continues to attract members who have an  interest in using digital technologies wisely and well. Do make use of  your membership log in to look at the archives where the useful and  interesting debates on mirandalink are stored. Look also at the new  resources that members have developed on a range of interesting topics  in the MirandaMods (<a href="../mirandamods/index.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/mirandamods</a>).</p>
<p>Our best resource are the case studies and articles published by Fellows. Two new publications follow:</p>
<h3>New Fellows</h3>
<p>We are pleased to announce Fellowships to those who have submitted  case studies and articles for MirandaNet publication. Each member who  publishes receives a certificate. Our next awards ceremony will be at  BETT12 (<a href="http://www.bettshow.com/">www.bettshow.com</a>)  where we are planning a conference- keep an eye on our newsletters for  more news. We hope those who have been awarded Fellowships will be able  to give presentations as well as those aspiring towards a Fellowship.</p>
<p><strong>Glenys Hart<br /> </strong>Glenys has sent us a case study which covers an international  perspective on how digital technolgies are deployed in different  countries. Not surprisingly participants were only able to discuss their  own regions of their countries, however, Glenys has come up with a  fascinating overview of development of ICT in learning through a series  of programmes over the space of nearly fifteen years. Starting with the  involvement in Web for Schools Project in Belgium in 1996, and Dublin in  1997, leading Teachers International Professional Developments visits  to schools Poland in 2002 and ECOTEC visit 2009; Norway in 2003; Hungary  (Budapest) in 2006; USA (Connecticut) 2005; China (Bejing) in 2004;  Canada (Montreal) 2007. Plus visits to Italian Schools in 2000, 2001 and  2002 and participation an Arion Educational Decision makers project to  Spain in 2002 on the theme of ICT in the Curriculum with staff from  Belgium, England, Finland, France, Holland, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden  and Poland. A number of visits have also been made to schools in UAE  and Australia. What an amazing range to draw on.</p>
<p>The evidence, of great interest to our international members, is  based on professional dialogues with colleagues who indicate that  information and Communications Technology ( ICT ) is a rapidly changing  subject. Glenys details findings about: ICT professional development;  signs of the reengineering of teaching and learning; appropriate  resource allocation; and technical support. From her conclusion you can  place your country in the continuum of learning she explains.</p>
<p>See <a href="../casestudies/264.html">ICT - an international perspective</a></p>
<p><strong>Simon Shaw</strong><br /> Simon has submitted a useful study about Exploiting ICT to improve  Parental Engagement which focuses on value driven improvement and  efficiency. In summary the paper explains how investment in new  technology is expensive and "technology led" change does not always lead  to more effective practice. It fact it is often difficult to show  measurable gain in performance or a quantifiable return on the  investment. However, once key technology enablers are in place - such as  sufficient levels of school and home access and familiarity with the  internet and devices - then significant benefit and efficiencies can be  gained by schools utilising technology to improve educational outcomes.  The rapid adoption of ICT to improve communication between parents and  schools in England is used as an illustrative example of a "value  proposition". The example shows how the availability of technology and a  campaign to communicate a set of expectations and educational benefits  have led to step changes to both parental engagement and efficiency  measures. More needs to be done to research and disseminate the "value  drivers" - such as parental engagement - that can lead to better  exploitation of technology when "tipping points" in the availability and  use of ICT are reached. Clearly communicated expectations and exemplar  practice can provide a "nudge" that enables schools to overcome  perceived barriers and lead to improved practice, changed behaviours,  greater efficiency and ultimately enhanced children's learning.</p>

<h3>New scholars</h3>
<p>As usual we have a wide range of scholars who have applied to join the MirandaNet Fellowship.</p>
<p><strong>The MirandaNet approach to learning</strong><br /> <strong>Elaine Dawson</strong> engages with the philosophy of MirandaNet  members when she says: I am about collaboration and building community.  One of the fundamental prerequisites to good quality learning is for  students to feel cared for and valued as individuals and as thinkers.  When this is achieved we give students the confidence to experiment with  new tools and concepts and to learn. ICT gives us the opportunity to  make learning exciting and relevant to future generations. Technology  removes limitations to creative thinking and provides a format for young  learners to excel. ICT has the potential to give me as an educator and a  learner the tools to fulfil these goals.</p>
<p><strong>Simon Beard</strong> is typical of many of us in the UK who  started thinking the MirandaNet way about digital technologies in the  1980s when he started with BBC Micros in the 1980s, remember them?</p>
<p><strong>Aprilla Suak </strong>hopes that by joining MirandaNet she  will learn a lot, broaden her knowledge and get more experiences that  can be shared with others here.</p>
<p><strong>Dean Sheetz</strong> also understands the MirandaNet approach  when he says: "MirandaNet seems to be much more oriented toward helping  individuals with achieving their teaching/learning goals than other  professional organizations in which I have held memberships in the past.  I am looking forward to taking an active role here". We hope you will  be publishing your first Fellowship study soon, Dean. Do ask for help if  you need it.</p>
<h4>Supporting members doing post graduate studies</h4>
<p>Like many of our members, Dave Emsley, is doing a Masters and is  looking to the Fellowship for inspiration. We try to cater for these  members who are interested in theory as well as practice. Many of our  Fellowship case studies reflect these interests. <strong>Ivan Kuzio</strong> is completing the MA in ICT in Education. His main thesis is  educational management, developing staff and leadership and e-learning. <strong>Mark Latus</strong> is also about to being a Masters in Educational Research. <strong>John Rack</strong>,  an expert in Dyslexia, has enjoyed a research career that has included 3  years working on a behaviour-genetic study of learning difficulties as  well as research on reading development and on educational applications  of ICT. <strong>Srdjan Vlaskalic</strong>, a PG Cert student of ICT at  Brunel University is looking for research findings in the area of the  accessibility of Educational Websites in the UK.</p>
<p>As MirandaNet members, those who are doing such studies in ICT can  apply to Christina Preston for summaries and drafts of relevant papers  as well as putting out requests on MirandaLink.</p>
<h4>A space for scientists</h4>
<p>We have quite a lot of teachers with a science background in our membership now. <strong>Ton Koenraad</strong>, for example, worked as a teacher educator and ICT-E consultant at Hogeschool Utrecht University of Applied Sciences. <strong>Albert Mutidzawanda</strong> is also a Physics teacher. <strong>David Obst</strong> is very interested in different experiences and opinions how to make an  effective teacher training and the use of interactive whiteboards in  physics (or science in general). He ahs already looked at our  interactive whiteboard archive that is kept up to date by John Cuthell  (url). <strong>Raghavendran Kalpathi</strong>, whose passion is Physics,  is typical of many new scholars who find the Fellowship by accident. He  says he is "thrilled to discover this fellowship and really want to be  part of the same". We hope to hear your views on mirandalink,  Raghavendran! Maybe you can even start a debate about the use of digital  technologies in Physics teaching.</p>
<h4>Wide interests underpinned by ICT</h4>
<p><strong>John Hobson</strong> has had a varied teaching career in  which he became dubious about top-down solutions to learning but is now  pleased by "the emergence of Personal Learning Environments, Infomatics  and Web 2.0 that have reinvigorated the subject, the teachers and most  importantly, the kids! The best is still to come". <strong>Nick Speller</strong> who was a Primary school teacher for eight years is currently a Primary  ICT Learning Consultant for Oxfordshire County Council, mainly working  with schools on the roll-out of a county-wide learning platform. <strong>Daniel Lynds</strong> is interested in inclusion, un-schooling, mobile and disruptive learning.</p>
<h4>Varied career backgrounds</h4>
<p>New scholars have varied roles in ICT: <strong>Lesley Holl</strong> manages a Learning Resources Centre at a Maths and Computing Specialist School: <strong>Nick Jeans</strong> is a Consultant in Learning Technology, with a particular interest in  Inclusion - engaging people who can't or won't access mainstream  education; <strong>Ralitsa Tareva</strong> is a UK qualified primary  teacher interested in continuing and developing her career in the  education system as an ICT specialist teacher.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Carrick-Davies</strong> is the well-known ex-CEO of  ChildNet international. His attitude to e-safety was sensible without  being hysterical and has had much impact on our professional approach to  this subject.</p>
<p>Our intake reflects the value of people who have come into teaching after time spent in other walks of life: <strong>Andrew Coulson</strong> is a newly qualified teacher after a career in electronics engineering: <strong>Drew Crow</strong> was a research scientist; <strong>Mark Curcher</strong> used to be in the finance industry. Mark is a executive committee  member and founder of the Global Learn international conference and a  founder of eduvator.net. He is interested in ideas for collaborative  projects with likeminded and enthusiastic colleagues from around the  world.</p>
<p><strong>Our Zimbabwean Chapter</strong><br /> We are also pleased to welcome more Zimbabweans who are setting up their  own MirandaNet chapter to share their professional knowledge within  Zimbabwe online: Gladson Chikwa; Gladys Mugabe; Charles Mugano: Albert  Mutidzawanda: Tellie Tapera Sithole and Noble Musavengana Sithole As  Gladys says they are keen "to join this fellowship to be able to  interact with people who share a similar vision regarding the use of ICT  in teaching and learning".</p>
<p>Warm regards to you all.</p>
<p>Dr Christina Preston</p>

<h3>Recent scholars list in detail</h3>
<p>Remember to keep your profile updated. We have been called the Face  Book of the international ICT community and your profile is probably the  first item about you comes up on Google. Try it! Google yourself!</p>
<p>Do get in touch with these new scholars if you have something in common with them...It is always good to welcome new members.</p>
<p><strong>Simon Beard</strong><br /> I have been interested in technology enhanced learning for a very long  time, originally participating in the nurse education CAL project, using  BBC micros, in the mid 1980's. When nurse education moved into higher  education, I was able to expand my interests, training staff and  students to use technology in libraries, and online learning, being part  of a team working on an original BL e-Lib project (<a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/services/elib/projects/eon/">eOn</a>).  Since then I have worked in FE and adult education colleges introducing  educational technology to those parts where it had previously not  reached. In recent times, whilst working for the <a href="http://www.citylit.ac.uk/">City Lit</a>, I have represented adult education on various BECTA projects, including the e-maturity framework, harnessing technology, <a href="http://feandskills.becta.org.uk/display.cfm?resID=41667">technology exemplar network</a>. I have worked on a <a href="http://www.alt.ac.uk/docs/central_londonv3.pdf">NLN projec</a>t, <a href="http://www.molenet.org.uk/projects/southeast/workingmens/">Molenet</a>, <a href="http://www.leadinglearning.info/moodle/">Transformation fund</a>, and various LSIS funded technology projects.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Carrick-Davies</strong><a href="mailto:Stephen@carrick-davies.com"><br /> </a>For the last 13 years I have been working in the field of E-safety,  first at Childnet international, (where I was CEO) and most recently as  an independent consultant and freelance trainer. Over this time I have  developed award-winning education resources and teaching tools to  support teachers, parents and learners understand the online risks and  responsibilities, including Cyberbullying and anti-social networking. I  have also considerable experience of working with companies and  Governments to review e-policies and practices, and have travelled  extensively to work with and support a very wide range of international  ICT education and safeguarding initiatives.</p>
<p>Currently I am undertaking research for the UK Government's Training  and Development Agency into what support teachers who work with excluded  children need when it comes to understanding and managing online risks.  See further details at <a href="http://www.carrick-davies.com/">www.carrick-davies.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Gladson Chikwa</strong><br /> I am a qualified secondary school science/biology teacher who taught in  Zimbabwean high schools for 8 years before becoming a University  Lecturer. I have a lot of interest in promoting effective teaching and  learning which is based on the needs of the learner as an individual,  that is, the use of learner centred approaches. Right now I am a third  year PhD student at the University of Sheffield and my research  interests are in ICT. My research project is focussed on the use of new  technologies in the teaching and learning of science at secondary school  level.In particular, I am looking at the use of Virtual Learning  Environments (VLEs) and Electronic Voting Systems (EVS) and the study is  being conducted in UK schools. My study is based on some psychological  aspects of learning that are not dominated by cultural considerations  and it is against this background that I think I will be able to use the  findings of the study beyond the UK boarders.In particular, the  experience I am gaining here will be of great value when I return to my  country as I intend to continue working as an educator/policy maker.</p>
<p>I am interested to join this fellowship to be able to interact with  people who share a similar vision regarding the use of ICT in teaching  and learning. I intend to use this platform to share my own experiences  and also to learn from others about the developments that are taking  place in this field.I also want to take advantage of the possibility to  publish my research findings with a view to interact more widely with  other researchers and experts in the field of ICT and its utility in  education.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Coulson</strong><br /> I'm a recently qualified teacher, having moved over from electronic  engineering. I have a keen interest in all things open source. My broad  interests in ICT are around seeking genuine value for money and finding  appropriate tools for teaching younger children. I am a fairly serious  photographer and am particularly interested in digital imaging.</p>
<p><strong>Drew Crow</strong><a href="mailto:dcrow@worcestershire.gov.uk"><br /> </a>I am a teacher advisor who works with primary and secondary schools  to integrate the effective use of technology into their curriculum and  use technology in innovative ways to engage their learners and enable  them to learn better. My background is as a Physics teacher and before  that a Research Scientist.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Curcher</strong><br /> I have been working in education for more than twenty years, having  previously worked in the finance industry. On completion of a BEd I  worked in further education in Saltash in Cornwall teaching business  courses before moving on to Newham Sixth Form College in the early  1990's. After a brief spell in a City Technology College I moved to  Dubai in 1995 to work in the business faculty of Dubai Men's College  (DMC) teaching finance and economics.</p>
<p>My interest in technology enhanced learning started at around this  time as I became involved in teaching basic courses in computing and  computer applications. DMC is just one campus of the Higher Colleges of  Technology, the federal government's higher education provision for its  local population. As campuses became wireless and we adopted a mandatory  requirement for students to have laptops, so we moved to a blended  learning model. Early adopters used Moodle as their LMS before the  college system invested in Web CT and then Blackboard Vista and made  these the mandatory CMS for the system. During this period I completed  the Open University MA in Online and Distance Education (MA ODE) and  also Certified Membership of the Association of Learning Technologists  (CMALT). I am currently registered on the Lancaster University PhD in  E-Research and Technology Enhanced Learning. I am also a member of US  based Association for the Advancement of Computers in Education (AACE)  and presented papers at E-Learn 2008 in Las Vegas, E- Learn 2009 in  Vancouver, Global Learn 2010 in Penang and I am due to present at Global  Learn 2011 in Melbourne in March. I have also presented papers in local  and regional conferences such as E-Learning Excellence Middle East in  Dubai in March 2010.</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in the opportunities for social and  collaborative learning that are afforded by the use of educational  technology and the use of social bookmarking to enhance student  learning. In 2007 I moved from the Business Faculty to the Department of  Learning Innovation where I have college wide responsibility for staff  and faculty professional development and support new initiatives in the  implementation of new technologies. I am currently the chair of a  committee examining the feasibility of the introduction of a BEd in  Educational Technology from September 2011. I am a executive committee  member and founder of the Global Learn international conference and a  founder of eduvator.net. I am always very happy to look at ideas for  collaborative projects with likeminded and enthusiastic colleagues from  around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Elaine Dawson</strong><br /> I entered the world of education at 4 years old and have not left since.  It is perhaps the only profession in the world that is never, ever  dull. I have been a team member and leader at my current school since  January 2006 where I discovered Sacred Heart Education and all it has to  offer its members as learners and community members.</p>
<p>I have over twelve years professional experience and in that time I  have been fortunate to teach in the UK, North Carolina USA and now in  New South Wales Australia.</p>
<p>I am passionate about finding innovative ways to stimulate students  and inspire their interest in learning. I want education to be exciting,  supportive and challenging. Our students have to have the ability to  compete in their adult professional lives and to contribute to global  society. I am interested in the challenge of leadership and making  tomorrow's leaders, something which has to begin with giving students  the opportunity to be leaders in their school career.</p>
<p>I am about collaboration and building community. One of the  fundamental prerequisites to good quality learning is for students to  feel cared for and valued as individuals and as thinkers. When this is  achieved we give students the confidence to experiment with new tools  and concepts and to learn. ICT gives us the opportunity to make learning  exciting and relevant to future generations. Technology removes  limitations to creative thinking and provides a format for young  learners to excel. ICT has the potential to give me as an educator and a  learner the tools to fulfil these goals.</p>
<p><strong>Dave Emsley</strong><br /> I'm ICT Coordination in a large Secondary School in North of England. Currently researching for my Masters in eLearning via SHU.</p>
<p><strong>John Hobson</strong><br /> I've worked in computers and communications since 1978. In the first  part of my carer I worked for Cable &amp; Wireless, BT and GE and I was  involved in may projects such as the first email service in the UK, the  LINK banking service and even constructing subs for cable repairs. I  found I was more interested in using this knowledge in help the next  generation and switched to education and deliberately worked in  difficult and challenging Schools. I was running a School intranet in  1995, installed the largest non US thin client system at the time in  1998 and had wireless linked secondary and primary School in 1999. I've  subsequently worked the in first Academy project in Bexley, an  experience that has left me very dubious of top down solutions.  Currently as Assistant Headteacher in Croydon I've found the emergence  of Personal Learning Environments, Infomatics and web 2.0 has  reinvigorated the subject, the teachers and most importantly, the kids!  The best is still to come.</p>
<p><strong>Lesley Hol</strong><br /> I manage the Learning Resources Centre at a Maths and Computing  Specialist School and have been involved in the development of our ICT  specialism.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Ilsley</strong><br /> Retired Primary school Headteacher, ex, London Borough of Tower Hamlets.  Part-time Associate/Link Tutor, University of Cumbria, East London.  Currently interested in the mismatch between how useful ICT is to  Teachers/Educators, and how useful it is to students/children/learners,  both locally and globally. I build computers from other people's  cast-offs. I collect and promote modern Thai painting.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Jeans</strong><br /> I am a Consultant in Learning Technology, with a particular interest in  Inclusion - engaging people who can't or won't access mainstream  education. I am currently working on an EU-funded digital inclusion  project called 'Making IT Personal' (<a href="http://www.makingitpersonal.org.uk/">www.makingitpersonal.org.uk</a>) and 'VISCED' (<a href="http://visced.referata.com/wiki/Main_Page">http://visced.referata.com/wiki/Main_Page</a>)  a worldwide study of e-learning in schools and colleges. I have 22  years' teaching experience, mostly in Adult Basic Skills. I piloted  LearnDirect Skills for Life courses at the Sheffield College and was an  e-learning mentor within the college, providing advice on how IT can be  used to enhance learning. I also worked with BECTA, visiting colleges to  show how IT can help in Skills for Life courses and managed Content  Development for the South Yorkshire E-Learning Programme, working with  teachers to produce and use e-learning resources in schools, colleges  and businesses. I do not, however, take the evangelical line that IT is  the answer to everything: e-maturity is sometimes knowing when it's  appropriate to turn off the computer.</p>
<p>I am Lead Assessor of the CMALT scheme (an award that recognises  effective use of Learning Technology), an accredited trainer for JISC  Techdis (promoting the use of IT for Inclusion) and a member of JISC's  Learning and Teaching Practice Experts Group.</p>
<p><strong>Raghavendran Kalpathi</strong><br /> I am Raghavendran. I have been teaching physics to Grade 12 and  undergraduate students for the past two and half decades.Teaching has  always been my first love and Physics my passion. I love to communicate  the excitement of physics to my students. I have realised over the years  that lectures supplemented by demonstrations, discussions , problem  solving ,brain storming session etc greatly enhance the learning  experience of the student.Over the years I have witnessed a lot of  changes in the way most subjects in general and Physics in particular is  taught.The advent of computers of course placed a very power tool in  the hands of a teacher . I stared to slowly integrate the computer into  my teaching methodology( using Ppt, learning simple programming etc). Of  course in a country like India this was difficult initially due to a  variety of reasons. but I persevered.My interest in ICT really started  when I started giving a course on Astrophysics to B.Sc Students. I  realised that in a topic like Astrophysics the use of ICT, particularly  the web resources available can greatly enhance the learning experience  of the student. I also realised that the explosion of information on the  net can be hindrance to a student . So the idea of creating a website  where I could place all the relevant material for the course occurred to  me. The site could have lecture notes, Assignments, Links to other  sites, online test, Simulations, Virtual labs... the list is end less.  So I stared working on the site a a year ago and have stared using it my  class. The initial success has been very encouraging. I want to go on  improving the same and make it a very good resource for learning. I  learnt about MirandaNet when I was browsing for information to present a  paper on Web resources and Teaching. . I am thrilled to discover this  fellowship and really want to be part of the same.</p>

<p><strong>Ivan Kuzio</strong><br /> I have a background in business and combined with an MBA, hold  qualifications in ICT from the University of Cambridge, the ECDL and  Adobe.</p>
<p>I have taught ICT for over ten years and recently introduced  "e-learning" and "enrichment" into my current school. I developed an  E-Safety Policy for this school, which has been used as a template for  other schools and most recently, the school was considered for an award  for Outstanding ICT Learning Initiative of the Year 2010.</p>
<p>I have been asked to present my ideas on "Games and Learning in ICT"  and "Successful teaching in ICT" to a number of international  conferences on ICT and Education.</p>
<p>I am currently at University completing the MA in ICT in Education.  My main thesis on the MA is educational management, developing staff and  leadership and e-learning.</p>
<p>I have also been approached to write an essential guide to e-learning  and teaching ICT by a well-known education publisher and have submitted  my first draft. I already have had some articles published in IT  Educational journals.</p>

<p><strong>Gladys Mugabe</strong><br /> I am the head of St Cyprian's Primary School in Marondera, Zimbabwe. I  would like to introduce computers in my school so that the whole school  will be computer alert and be part of the global village.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Mugano</strong><br /> I am an Education Officer employed by the Ministry of Education in its  Planning Division and am stationed in Manicaland one of the ten  educational provinces in the country. My work involves ensuring that as  many schools in my province as possible introduce computers in their  curriculum. Such efforts ate supported through sourcing computers  through government funding or through identification of donors.  Identified schools are encouraged to ensure as many pupils are literate.  Schools are encouraged to be on the internet and to ensure pupils have  access to the facility. Periodic visits to schools are made in order to  ensure effective teaching of the subject. Updated data on schools doing  computers is kept.I therefore have an insatiable desire to improve my  own ICT skills and an even greater one to ensure tomorrows generation in  my country are at par and can compete favourably with piers the world  over.</p>
<p><strong>Albert Mutidzawanda</strong><br /> I am a Physics lecturer at Mutare Teachers' College. I am the HOD for  the recently introduced B Sc degree programme. The degree is offered  on-line and is heavily dependent on ICT usage for both students and  lecturers.</p>
<p><strong>David Obst</strong><br /> My name is David Obst and I work at the department of physics education  at the Technische Universit&auml;t Dresden (Saxony, Germany). My research  project is about the use of interactive whiteboards in physics.</p>
<p>The number of interactive whiteboards is growing very fast in  Germany, but there is a big lack of adequate teacher training. Different  studies from the UK have shown that teacher training is a very  important point for a good use and better acceptance. The aim is to  develop and evaluate a teacher training to use the interactive  whiteboards in physics. This training, which is taken place on two days  each eight hours, will include not only "technical use" but also really  subject-specific content.</p>
<p>Especially I'd like to see if it is possible with this teacher  training not only to motivate the teachers and open their minds for new  ideas but to really change their way of teaching in an observable way.  To see if this is possible, I'd like to use a Pre-Post research design  including surveys for teacher and people and observing lessons.</p>
<p>I am very interested in different experiences and opinions how to  make an effective teacher training and the use of interactive  whiteboards in physics (or science in general).</p>
<p><strong>Edward Misava Ombajo</strong><br /> Am a teacher/lecturer in ICT and would like to share about your site with my students as we address ICT use in teaching.</p>
<p><strong>John Rack</strong><br /> I work part time for Dyslexia Action as Head of Research and  Professional Development. In this new post I am responsible for the  evaluation and professional development of Dyslexia Action's national  teaching, assessment and training services. I am also responsible for  the Education Committee consisting of external advisors with the task of  ensuring that practice within the organisation reflects the most  up-to-date research evidence.</p>
<p>I am also Co-Director of the Dyslexia-SplD Trust, responsible for the  delivery of a government-funded programme of work that is delivered by  the Trust staff and partner organisations. This work centres on advice  in the development of standards in assessment, teaching and training and  the promotion of evidence-based educational practice. As the Trust  serves as Government's link organisation with the voluntary sector, the  Director's role requires extensive participation in meetings and  networking events and contributions to briefing papers, articles and  other publications.</p>
<p>The work for the Dyslexia-Specific Learning Difficulties Trust  developed from the publication of Sir Jim Rose's independent report to  Government 'Identifying and Supporting pupils with dyslexia and literacy  difficulties'. I had served on the on the Expert Advisory Group to Sir  Jim Rose's review and contributed significantly to the review process  and the final report. I was also member of the Government Working Party  which produced guidance in 2005 on assessment standards for Specific  Learning Difficulties in Higher Education and I continue to serve on  SASC- the National body charged with maintaining standards in assessment  of Specific Learning Difficulties.</p>
<p>My research career has included 3 years working on a  behaviour-genetic study of learning difficulties as well as research on  reading development and on educational applications of ICT. I was the UK  partner of a EU-funded research project on developing software to  promote inclusive literacy teaching AGENT-DYSL.</p>
<p><strong>Simon Shaw</strong><br /> Simon Shaw gained his Fellowship soon after joining (see above). <br /> As a pupil Simon Shaw was an original "micro-kid" in the early 80's,  using a BBC compute to write educational software for use in school. His  interest in developing applications and systems that enhance learning,  teaching and management has stayed with him throughout his career. His  experience within education includes being teaching Physics, Chemistry,  Science, Technology, ICT, Mathematics, Music and Outdoor Activities as  well as being ICT coordinator at a specialist language college and  developing a whole school pupil tracking and reporting system.</p>
<p>Simon was Head of Institutional Management at Becta. During his 9  years at Becta his roles included; managing research into Total Cost of  Ownership, leading the ICT Test Bed Project, developing the ICT Mark  Accreditation scheme and managing the initiative for improving Parental  Engagement through Online Reporting. Research has been a key aspect of  each of these roles, respectively; managing research directly,  disseminating the outcomes of teacher led action research, developing  evidence based assessment methodologies and performing secondary  analysis of harnessing technology data to demonstrate improved  efficiencies through ICT enabled practice.</p>
<p>Simon is currently interested in the contribution that practice based  research can make to creating "value propositions" for the use of ICT  within education.</p>
<p><strong>Dean Sheetz</strong><br /> I have been an educator for 14 years. For the past 11 years, I have been  integrating technology into my classes in various ways at Dubai Men's  College. I am a business teacher with an active research interest in  visual communication assisted by various technologies (for example,  Prezi, Compendium, Screencasting, Dialogue Mapping). In the past I have  done research on integrating Blogs and Wikis into content classes for  second language students. As all of our students are all learning in a  second language, teaching content can be quite a challenge. Technology  can help overcome the difficulties in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>I have a BS in Math, an MA in English and a Ph.D. in Organization and  Management. I consider myself to be a lifelong learner and I have a  wide variety of interests. Unfortunately my available time is limited,  which makes capitalizing on my curiosity a constant challenge. My wife  and I have a one-year-old boy, and making sure he has as much variety of  opportunity as possible for exploring and learning about the world is  one of our primary concerns.</p>
<p>MirandaNet seems to be much more oriented toward helping individuals  with achieving their teaching/learning goals than other professional  organizations in which I have held memberships in the past. I am looking  forward to taking an active role here.</p>
<p><strong>Noble Musavengana Sithole</strong><br /> so many children leave school without any knowledge of operating a  computer and fall into a world where this knowledge is primary  requisite. this is the case with most children who graduate from rural  secondary schools. I feel that children should be introduced to  computers at preschool . computers have become part of every day life so  children should grow with computers the same way they grow with toys.  if this happens children will not be bewildered by computer technology  at school ;at college or at the work place later on in life. My focus is  on Zimbabwe.</p>
<p><strong>Tellie Tapera Sithole</strong><br /> A seasoned and very keen to learn, a creative, hardworking and  illustrious man whose keen interest is to inspire and build well  modelled scholars, which I have done for the past 39 years.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Speller</strong><br /> Having been a Primary school teacher for eight years I am currently a  Primary ICT Learning Consultant for Oxfordshire County Council, mainly  working with schools on the roll-out of a county-wide learning platform.  I also have a great interest in Handheld and Game-based learning,  heading up projects in both aspects of Primary Learning for OCC.

<p><strong>Aprilla Suak</strong><br /> My name is Aprilla Monika Suak. I am an English teacher in SMA Katolik  Aquino Amurang, a senior high school in Amurang, South Minahasa Regency,  North Sulawesi, Indonesia. I know MirandaNet from a good friend of mine  from Netherlands who came to my school with his team to give science  workshop for the teachers. After the workshop, more teachers in my  school got more interested in using ICT in teaching and learning  process. I have been using ICT for teaching and learning and have found  it very useful for everybody involved in improving education. By joining  MirandaNet I hope I will learn a lot, broaden my knowledge and get more  experiences that can be shared with others here.</p>
<p><strong>Ralitsa Tareva</strong><br /> I am an UK qualified primary teacher interested in continuing and  developing my career in the education system as an ICT specialist  teacher. I have gained a wealth of experience both in the IT industry as  a web &amp; graphic designer and trainer as well as in the education  sector, working as both an ICT teacher and school website administrator.  It is my belief that through structured links between the curriculum  and ICT teaching, students benefit both from a deeper understanding of  technology and a better grasp of all the subjects learned in class.</p>
<p><strong>Srdjan Vlaskalic</strong><br /> I am a PG Cert student of ICT at Brunel University. As a part of my  certification course I have chosen an assignment with following title:  "Accessibility of Educational Websites in the UK - Analysis of the  current status and a proposal for a ranking methodology". I am actively  searching for the literature or similar research in that area.</p>
