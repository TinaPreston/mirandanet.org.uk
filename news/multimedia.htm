<p>At Cheam School in Berkshire, teachers have been experimenting with multimedia 
    to communicate with fellow students in Beijing. They are using the exchange 
    of audio visual resources to bring the project to life. Extra visual and sound 
    clues are being used to help students understand intuitively what life is 
    like in another country. </p>
  <p>This project has grown out of Cheam School's strong belief in the advantages 
    of international partnerships between schools as a normal part of the education 
    process. Their pupils already work with establishments in the USA and China, 
    and they are now looking for partnerships with schools in Africa. Their ultimate 
    aim is to create a network of schools exchanging projects, news and experiences 
    across the world with Cheam as the co-ordinating hub.</p>
  <p>For example, instead of just sending stills and text, the teachers are planning 
    the exchange of voice commentaries about a particular aspect of local history 
    and a short video of our investigation of how caterpillars develop into butterflies. 
    For the Chinese children who are not working in their first language teachers 
    hope that sound and animation will assist understanding. </p>
  <p><strong><a name="ex"></a>The Exchange Experience</strong></p>
  <p>Because of the international exchange approach at Cheam multi-media communication 
    in the form of video is a fundamental part of the exchange activity, allowing 
    pupils to both see and hear children from abroad explaining their work and 
    environment. Before the introduction of digital technology Cheam had to convert 
    their work from PAL into whatever format their partner schools use, generally 
    NTSC. </p>
  <p>The Primary Head used to take the VHS tapes to the audio visual department 
    of the local University, wait two weeks for them to be processed and posted 
    back, then paid &pound;15 per cassette for the privilege. In the early days 
    when there was only one partnership this was tolerable, but as the volume 
    of interchanges and number of partnerships grew both the time and financial 
    burden became excessive. </p>
  <p><strong><a name="eq"></a>The equipment schools need</strong></p>
  <p>We've learned a lot since then. This is the kind of equipment for schools 
    who would like to do the same kind of project. </p>
  <p>The first and simplest form of media we can exchange, the audio cassette, 
    comes in a light compact case and uses a global standard format which can 
    be heard using a player costing &pound;30 or less. The second form, a video 
    recording, uses a much larger cassette that utilises a format which is by 
    no means global and costs at least &pound;15 to convert from say PAL to NTSC. 
  </p>
  <p>An audio cassette is relatively cheap to send around the world, the much 
    heavier video cassette costs significantly more in addition to the burden 
    of conversion. So what solutions do we have available that will allow us to 
    maintain multimedia contact with our partner schools abroad without breaking 
    our meagre budgets in the process? </p>
  <p>Digital video has opened up new avenues for processing and sharing educational 
    material easily, cheaply and globally in formats that can be played on any 
    modern personal computer. We no longer have to consider which video format 
    the partner school might use or even incur postage costs. We can produce professional 
    looking results with software which is cheap and easy to use straight out 
    of the box. </p>
  <p><strong><a name="dt"></a>Digital Technology</strong></p>
  <p>At about the same time the School bought several digital still cameras and 
    a digital video camera complete with editing software which was loaded onto 
    a computer that had a re-writable CD drive. This meant that any videos and 
    stills taken by Cheam could now be properly edited, titled and saved in a 
    variety of formats for CD or Web playback.</p>
  <p>In line with Cheam's international policy the first avenue to be explored 
    was the Web because it promised the widest coverage with the least cost of 
    distribution and conversion. Video taken at Cheam's May Fair was used as the 
    test subject because it contained both static and moving images coupled with 
    speech and music lasting six and a half minutes. Saving this in standard Real 
    Player format produced a 1.7 megabyte file suitable for replaying over a 56K 
    modem link. After loading it into a web directory we tested the replay over 
    a standard BT line and found that the action was stilted like an early black 
    and white newsreel. </p>
  <p>The more the camera panned the worse the image became and only static shots 
    produced a watchable result in a small 'normal view' RealPlayer window. However, 
    in the classroom environment where the image is shown on a standard monitor 
    or via a projector then at least a double sized window is needed. In this 
    case the playback was fuzzy and the newsreel effect magnified to the point 
    where much of the detail was lost and the action stilted. Even reproducing 
    this clip in Windows Media Player did not overcome the quality and fluidity 
    problems.</p>
  <p><strong><a name="s"></a>The Solution</strong></p>
  <p>As part of initiating a relationship with a Chinese school we put together 
    a CD of stills and video to produce a range of 'typical' scenes from the Berkshire/Hampshire 
    countryside. We included the Cheam May Fair sequence, but this time we made 
    use of the CD's capacity and saved the video in MPEG, this time resulting 
    in a file size of over 50 megabytes. In this format the action was fluid and 
    clear even in full screen mode, and the sound was perfect, exactly what we 
    needed for classroom projection. </p>
  <p>Having approached this extreme we then went back to the smaller file sizes 
    we needed for our web site and played with the options until we obtained RealPlayer 
    and Windows Media Player files of around 7 megabytes. At this level we had 
    reasonable upload times, even without the benefit of broadband, and kept the 
    format sufficiently compact for playback over a 56k line. As a side effect 
    this also allowed us to have an easy rule of thumb for estimating playback 
    file sizes - one minute of run time produces approximately one megabyte.</p>
  <p><strong><a name="f"></a>The Future</strong></p>
  <p>Our ultimate aim is to collect projects from schools all over the world and 
    categorise them within a simple web site for re-use by the schools working 
    within the Cheam framework. The material will cover every aspect of the curriculum 
    from studies of 'where we live' through to time delay photography of plants, 
    insects and hatching chicks. In addition we want to produce behind the scenes 
    footage of how project folders are put together before being shipped abroad 
    or how events such as the school play are rehearsed and produced. </p>
  <p>Where possible we want to specifically target areas of life which emphasise 
    differences in culture and custom. For example in the USA they pledge allegiance 
    to the flag and celebrate thanksgiving, whereas in the UK we have morning 
    assemblies and harvest festivals. By combining existing educational practice 
    with the facilities that modern technologies can provide so easily at minimal 
    cost, we will not only enhance the children's learning experience but also 
    encourage and foster greater international understanding amongst our respective 
    pupils.</p>
