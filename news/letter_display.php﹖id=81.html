Go to the website to see the video presentations, download  resources and view the beginnings of a collaborative map:</p> <ul><li><a href="../mirandamods/march10_mod.htm">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/mirandamods/march10_mod.htm</a></li></ul> <p>The second instalment that promises to be equally heated is coming up  on March 29<sup>th</sup>  at the Games Based conference at the Brewery  in London. You will find  details of this second MirandaMod at the end of the same page:</p> <ul><li><a href="../mirandamods/march10_mod.htm">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/mirandamods/march10_mod.htm</a></li></ul> <h3>Doctorate</h3> <p>Congratulations to Dr. John Potter, one of our longest standing  members who gained his doctorate without having to do any corrections.  No mean feat. Well done. He can be seen discussing primary ICT for  Futurelab and is featured on their podcast at:</p> <ul><li><a href="http://media.futurelab.org.uk/podcasts/becta_talks/primary_education/">http://media.futurelab.org.uk/podcasts/becta_talks/primary_education</a></li></ul> <h3>Fellowship Award</h3> <p>Delighted to announce a Fellowship award to Keith Heggart in Australia who has been writing about a World Ecitizens project, <a href="../casestudies/252.html">The Avatar project</a>,  a 12 week program undertaken at St Mark&#39;s Catholic College, Australia,  with the aim of generating opportunities for students to undertake  active citizenship in the local and global community.  He quotes new  research in this area that says:</p> <p>&quot;Citizenship education should not necessarily be focused on knowledge  about political and social institutions, but instead be directed  towards the development of young people towards becoming active citizens  and members of their community.&quot;</p> <p>These active approaches fall in line with MirandaNetters intentions  when they founded the charity World Ecitizens. Keith very much gave the  students their head and ended up with 30 different proposals on the  server. Time was set aside for students to watch the presentations and  then vote online for the  proposals they thought had the most merit. The  voting process was hosted on the school learning platform and the two  that won were Pink Daffodil Day and The Environmental Group.&quot;</p> <h4>Opportunities for members</h4> <p>Keith would like to extend the range of these projects to involve  MirandaNet members in World Ecitizens exchange. Every young person who  publishes on the World Ecitizens website is awarded a certificate. Let  us know if you want to be involved. You will find Keith&#39;s article here:</p> <ul><li><a href="../casestudies/252.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/casestudies/mnet/252</a></li></ul> <h4>Achieving a senior Fellowship</h4> <p>Keith already planning his senior Fellowship submission about his  trials using iPhones in an educational setting with a number of  Vocational Education students. &quot;It&#39;s a very exciting project,&quot; he says, &quot;  and I hope to share the findings soon&#39;. Do you have anything to share?  Do get in touch.</p> <h3>Fellowship  debates</h3> <p>Are you aware that you can gain your Fellowship by summarising a  debate and using this text as a base for your own comments or add  further information about the topic to make up an article? So far this  year Members have raised some interesting topics and, generally  speaking, more of our members are contributing where they have knowledge  or opinions. I hope our international members will continue to rescue  the discussions from becoming too UK-centric.</p> <ul><li>Concerns about the variable costs of broadband services to schools</li><li>Challenges of online reporting</li><li>The lack of an overarching national/international infrastructure for professional networking</li><li>The value of computer games in education</li><li>World Ecitizenship exchanges in India</li><li>Parental engagement</li><li>School web portals and learning platforms</li><li>Using English in school for learning</li><li>The Impact of ICT in education</li><li>Video conferencing- ways and warnings</li><li>Where were you in the snow?</li></ul> <h4>Accessing the MirandaNet archives</h4> <p>You can now find members comments in the MirandaNet archives. Francis explains</p> <p>When you log on to the Members&#39; Area on MirandaNet (look for the link  at the lower end of the menu) you will now see a link to the  MirandaLink Archive where you can catch up on any past items that you  wish to savour again. You can even download a month&#39;s supply of past  messages in zipped format if you so wish. The archive only goes back to  when we changed servers last July.</p> <h4>Starting your own discussion thread</h4> <p>In case you do not know we do not use our web based forums for these  debates because we find that the most effective way still of maintaining  momentum in discussion is just to use email.. and for some members who  have limited access to broadband this ensures their equal participation  in debate. Members are encouraged to start their own threads. Your  participation will enrich the value of sharing professional learning.  Ask for my help if you have an issue you want to launch but feel a  little shy....<a href="mailto:christina@mirandanet.ac.uk"></a></p> <p>One of our discussion threads prompted this response:</p> <h4>Where we you in the snow?</h4> <p><strong>Tom Rank</strong>, one of our MirandaNetters, was gritting his teeth and enjoying the snow, as well as the puns:</p> <ul><li><a href="http://blog.literaryconnections.co.uk/">http://blog.literaryconnections.co.uk</a></li></ul> <p>&quot;More seriously (as we must be, of course), it&#39;s been interesting to  read the MirandaNet comments saying this was both &#39;a fine advert for  some sort of VLE&#39; and that the learning platforms the teachers have to  use are &#39;too slow, too locked down, not what we use, never work&#39;.</p> <p>In the light of Stephen Heppell&#39;s comments on the widespread use of  free, non-institutional, applications such as Google Docs, etc, I wonder  how long it will be before learning platforms become redundant?</p> <p>Just the right time, perhaps, to mention that the National  Association for the Teaching of English is looking for teachers to  explore how (or even if?) learning platforms can enhance teaching and  learning in English. There&#39;s some funding for teachers case studies -  more details here:</p> <ul><li><a href="http://www.nate.org.uk/index.php?page=1&amp;news=73">http://www.nate.org.uk/index.php?page=1&amp;news=73</a></li></ul> <p>or get in touch with</p> <ul><li>Tom Rank, Chair, NATE ICT Committee<a href="mailto:tom@literaryconnections.co.uk"></a></li></ul> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Brenda Bigland</strong> of Lent Rise School found  that their learning platform came into its own when faced with the snow  problems!&nbsp;You can see a nice report on the web site:</p> <ul><li><a href="../publications/lent_rise.htm">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/publications/lent_rise.htm</a></li></ul> <h3>Will iPads change what we read and how?</h3> <p><strong>Geoff Scott Baker</strong> draws our attention to an article  about the iPad that makes a global roll-out  a distinct possibility with  competitors joining the party. Should this be one of our next topics of  conversation?</p> <p>Geoff thinks the iPad has started the ball rolling for illustrated  text books to go electronic.  &quot;The wifi connection will allow  tutors/teachers to &#39;push&#39; assignments to students&#39; eReaders in a more  interesting format than the monochrome Kindle. Pre-travel video tours in  preparation for site visits and illustrated onsite quizzes with  built-in pre-formatted assignment report output capability have also  become feasible.</p> <p>The only question is....will the new wave of eReader software  developers address that market, and who will fund the eReaders in  schools?</p> <p>The article can be found here....</p> <ul><li><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/drosensweig-lands-at-textbook-renter-cheggcom/?th&amp;emc=th">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/drosensweig-lands-at-textbook-renter-cheggcom/?th&amp;emc=th</a></li></ul> <h3>Computers in Classrooms Special Announcement</h3> <p>The expert and prolific Terry Freedman has been busy creating new  free resources for teachers and advisers. So new I have not had time to  review yet but we could be pleased to publish any reviews in the next  newsletter.  Terry  says:</p> <p>A new, revamped, much expanded version of the Web 2.0 projects book is now ready!<br /> For MirandaNetters here is the URL <a href="http://www.ictineducation.org/free-stuff/">www.ictineducation.org/free-stuff</a></p> <p>Here is some information about the book:</p> <p><strong>At last!

And what they recommend you do if you run them.</li><li>What were the learning outcomes?</li><li><strong>And did I mention that this is free?! </strong><br />     &nbsp;</li></ul> <h3>BETT 2010</h3> <p>We met plenty of old friends and made some new ones at BETT10.</p> <p>If you missed the show Terry Freedman has written a newsletter  containing the views of a number of people about BETT, ie what they saw  that &#39;wow&#39;ed them, plus various news items.</p> <ul><li><a href="http://ymlp.com/zr2Wkj">http://ymlp.com/zr2Wkj</a></li></ul> <p>Leon Cych has also blogged about BETT10 in Learn4Life</p> <ul><li><a href="http://www.l4l.co.uk/?cat=98">http://www.l4l.co.uk/?cat=98</a></li></ul> <h3>Conference News 2010</h3> <h4>MirandaNetters in the US, New Zealand, Australia and Japan in 2010</h4> <p>Members of MirandaNet will be travelling the world in March and April  2010.
