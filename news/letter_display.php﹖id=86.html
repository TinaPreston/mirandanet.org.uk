My  interests include adolescent counselling, action research,teaching  methodologies,learning strategies, etc. Presently I am the Principal of  Podar International School in Chinchwad, Pune, India.</p> <p><strong>S.Simran Kaur</strong><a href="mailto:sim_36111@yahoo.com"></a></p> <p>To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe. Anatole France</p> <p>I believe that children have always been the most important resource  for our society, for the nation and to the world.. Every institution  should endeavour to develop a strong responsible and respectful citizen  with the deep sense of values and ethics. Hence I strive to create an  atmosphere for the growth of the institution by using my inherent  spirituality, strength, knowledge and experience. I am MA Sociology and  Bachelor of Education from University of Annamalai.</p> <p>I am strong and determined, focus on the results of the students and a  consistent quest of outstanding performance in the field of education  has made a solid platform for a successful educational guide.</p> <p>My interests in ICT are</p> <ul><li>Interactive white boards</li><li>Power point presentations</li><li>Visual learning</li><li>Computer projects</li></ul> <p>With best wishes</p> <p>Simran K</p> <p><strong>Prashant Muley</strong><a href="mailto:prashantmuley@podar.net"></a></p> <p>&quot;Excellence in everything we do&quot; is the guiding thought for me in  life and makes me a perfectionist or to strive towards the same. I  always make sure that teachers use ICT extensively in our school. Having  interest in Educational Management and Administration I am keen on the  use of ICT in transacting the curriculum. Having joined MirandaNet, I am  sure that I will be able to explore a lot of new ideas and interact and  share with friends world-over.</p> <p><strong>Sreenarayanan Palatchrakkara</strong><a href="mailto:palat.csn@gmail.com"></a></p> <p>I am trained post graduate (MSc: B.Ed) with over 20 years of  experience in the field of education in the capacity of biology teacher  and principal. I have worked with different educational boards in India  and Dubai following IGCSE, CBSE and ICSE syllabi.</p> <p>I am a strong believer who advocates the philosophy &quot;seeing is  believing&quot;. ICT is the integral part of education where children have a  hands on experience simplifying the teaching and learning process to the  minimum.</p> <p><strong>Ganesh Parameswaran</strong><a href="mailto:pgan@podar.net"></a></p> <p>I try to be friends with all. Think I could learn from all I come in  contact with. I understand the immense potential of ICT in learning and  am personally comfortable with e-learning. I would like to push for the  use of ICT where the benefits are obvious. I would however like to keep  the human element at the centre of all endeavours of the school that I  am mandated to lead.</p> <p><strong>Ramdas Pawar</strong><a href="mailto:rdpawar@podar.net"></a></p> <p>I think the ICT is here to stay and the generation of the people /  experts / teachers who are handing it over to the young generation is  not doing it with the conviction which is why it has cultural gaps.  Unfortunately the technology is so dynamic it is not giving any  breathing space to ponder over the validity of it.</p> <p>It is just changing in look and the ability.</p> <p>ICT is no more a change, it is a dynamic reality. The only thing is  we are not yet equipped to render our life digitally. Quite possibly the  day must be lurking somewhere near by. Who knows?</p> <p><strong>G C Rao</strong><a href="mailto:gcrao@podar.net"></a></p> <p>Mr G C Rao brings with him a great experience and success of working  in reputed English medium Modern public schools. He had a long stint  with Delhi Public Schools managed by the DPS Society, New Delhi and was  the Founder Principal and Educational Consultant of the B K Birla Centre  for Education, Pune for eight years. He was also the Educational  consultant/Advisor to Birla Public School, Doha, Qatar and had a short  stint of about two years with the Multi-crore Sree Vidyanikethan  Educational Trust.</p> <p>He is a Teacher leader and trainer with a passion for imparting  quality modules of Education such as Class management, Class control and  interaction, Discipline as a way of life, Never to denigrate a child,  etc and has made special contributions in the direction of School  management and administration. He feels strongly that schools cannot  maintain a position of moated self-sufficiency due to the onslaught of  Electronic technology which is transforming the global communication  systems by accelerating the processing, development and delivery of  information. Mr. Rao firmly believes in a caring school and aspires to  make suitable refinements in existing practice, develop renovated  curriculum, or redesign key components of their operation to make  productive changes.</p> <p>Though his principal interest lies with Boarding and Day-cum-boarding  schools for which he has earned many accolades in creating and managing  such schools, he is not an alien to day schools. He strongly believes  in humanizing education with a secular outlook and wishes to combine the  best of the east with the west in making his profession meaningful to  Indian conditions. Prior to joining Podars, he was with Dr D Y Patil&rsquo;s  International schools for more than two years looking after their  IGCSE/IB world schools as Principal.</p> <p>Mr G C Rao holds Masters Degree in Science, English, History and  Political Science with a degree in Teacher training and he has also been  honoured with the awards like Vidya Shree, Samaj Shree, SGE award, etc.</p> <p><strong>Vaishali Ranasubay</strong><a href="mailto:vaishaliranasubay@yahoo.in"></a></p> <p>Hi! I am a teacher at PIS, Chinchwad, Pune. I am proud to be a part  of this noble profession. The day I have joined my institution I have  been using technology extensively. The use of technology has helped me  to whitewash the orthodox methods of teaching and learning process. I  would like to learn more in this area.</p> <p>When in the mid of May I got an opportunity to be a part of Moodle it  exposed me and my thoughts globally. I thank my institution for it as  well as Mrs. Preston, Mr. John and Mr. Allen for their valuable  contribution.</p> <p><strong>Timir Kumar Sengupta</strong><a href="mailto:timir.k.sengupta@podar.net"></a></p> <p>In the current school education system without ICT programme  classroom teaching cannot be successful and also completed. It is very  much knowledge based education procedure. This gives us different source  of information related to modern education system. It has all  scientific approach therefore I want to become a member of MirandaNet.</p> <p><strong>Usha Shettigar</strong><a href="mailto:ushashettigar@gmail.com"></a></p> <p>I have realized that technology is here to stay.  Its use in  education is of utmost importance as our future citizens / present  pupils need to learn its use and implementation in gaining knowledge  necessary for them to become productive world citizens.</p> <p>In this  process, it absolutely necessary for teachers to update  themselves with the resources using ICT and its implementation in their  teaching-learning process.</p> <p><strong>Abhaykumar Sontakke</strong><a href="mailto:abhaykumar.sontakke@gmail.com"></a></p> <p>In recent years there has been a groundswell of interest in how  computers and the Internet can best be harnessed to improve the  efficiency and effectiveness of education at all levels and in both  formal and non-formal settings. But ICTs are more than just these  technologies; older technologies such as the telephone, radio and  television, although now given less attention, have a longer and richer  history as instructional tools. For instance, radio and television have  for over forty years been used for open and distance learning, although  print remains the cheapest, most accessible and therefore most dominant  delivery mechanism in both developed and developing countries. The use  of computers and the Internet is still in its infancy in developing  countries, if these are used at all, due to limited infrastructure and  the attendant high costs of access.</p> <p><strong>Priya Venkatesh</strong><a href="mailto:priyav22@gmail.com"></a></p> <p>I am always interested in knowing more about novel methods of  education and how they can contribute to the overall development of a  child. As Professor Abdul Kalam, the honourable ex-President of India  stated &quot;Education is the best defence of a nation&quot;. If we think about  the world as one nation, we can see how education would benefit the  world as a whole.</p> <h2>Members</h2> <p><strong>Maryam Alvi</strong><a href="mailto:maryam.alvi@live.com"></a></p> <p>To interact with the teachers all around the world.</p> <p><strong>Ghazala Arshad</strong><a href="mailto:messageofpeace1@hotmail.com"></a></p> <p>I am curious to learn ICT skills. Although I am using new  technologies including exploring the internet, software and and  multi-media to make my lessons interesting and thought-provoking, even  so I am keen to learn more.</p> <p><strong>Farhana Ashiq</strong><a href="mailto:princesfarhanakausar@yahoo.com"></a></p> <p>I am an English teacher in a good reputed school. I want to learn new ideas to improve my teaching skills.</p> <p><strong>Anila Atta</strong><a href="mailto:lily410@yahoo.com"></a></p> <p>I would like to use this website to enhance teaching techniques.</p> <p><strong>Jasmine Khare</strong><a href="mailto:mikejinu@yahoo.co.in"></a></p> <p>I have completed my Post Graduation in English and Mass Relations. I  believe that learning never stops at any stage and at any point. Each  experience in one&#39;s life adds to his bag of knowledge and understanding.</p> <p>I like experimenting and exploring new methods of learning.</p> <p>It&#39;s my conviction that class room is the field where a teacher has all the resources at his/her disposal.</p> <p><strong>Aliya Irfan</strong><a href="mailto:aliairfan76@gmail.com"></a></p> <p>I am teacher in a well reputed school.

Please pass  some related materials, innovative techniques which can be very well  used in the school level.</p> <p><strong>Muhammad Rafi</strong><a href="mailto:muhammad_rafi@ymail.com"></a></p> <p>I&#39;m a true professional teacher with double masters (Eng and Isl)  along with B.Ed. and am very much interested in Islamic History and wish  to be a true representative of the Muslims in future.</p> <p><strong>Dhanashri Phadnis</strong><a href="mailto:phadnis.d@gmail.com"></a></p> <p>I have completed post graduation in English.
