Christine has already been with us to South Africa on the E-Lapa visit.  </p><p> <strong>New Fellows</strong>  </p><p> Read their personal statements and look at their profiles on our website </p><p> <strong>Mark Benison</strong>  		 </p><p> <strong>Peter Calder</strong><br />  	 <a href="../profiles/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=367.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/profiles/profile.php?prof=367</a> </p><p><strong>Katya Toneva</strong><br /><a href="../profiles/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=83.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/profiles/profile.php?prof=83</a> </p><p> <strong>Stella Cattini-Muller</strong><br />		 <a href="../profiles/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=390.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/profiles/profile.php?prof=390</a> </p><p> <strong>Benjamin Semwayo</strong><br />  I obtained the Secondary Teacher&#39;s Certificate from Gwelo Teachers&#39; College, Zimbabwe, in 1980 and taught at two secondary schools before transferring to St Augustine&#39;s High School in 1980, where I was to remain until 2002. During the course of my service my stay at St Augustine&#39;s I assumed a number of positions of responsibility, including Head of department of Guidance and Counselling, sixth form boys&#39; Housemaster, Careers Counsellor and Tennis Coach. I was very successful as an English teacher, winning the Teacher-of-the-year award in 1995 when my class of forty &#39;O&#39; level English pupils passed with 36 As and 4Bs. </p><p> While I was at St Augustine&#39;s I also actively engaged myself in personal development, academically. I obtained a diploma in Business Studies, a BA degree with majors in Industrial Psychology, Sociology and Communication, and a diploma in Personnel Management. I plan to do more studies, and in fact I think I will be learning for the rest of my life. I am currently reading for the Post Graduate Certificate in Educational Technology, and hope to proceed to the Masters level. I am also studying Computers. </p><p> In my research study for the Post Graduate Certificate in Educational Technology I studied Supply teachers and Information Technology, with particular reference to educational discussion forums. I had observed that supply teachers do not use IT much in their professional work, and I sought answers to questions such as the following: What is the general level of supply teachers&#39; IT skills? How many of them have personal computers at home? How many are connected to the Internet? How much do they use computers in their work? Have they ever heard of discussion forums? Do they participate in discussion forums?  I have completed the study, and the results will be published by Mirandanet. </p><p> In my spare time I enjoy fishing, playing tennis and playing my guitar. I am a practising Christian and I spend some of my time attending Church services and functions. </p><p> <strong>Eddy Jackson</strong><br />  <a href="../profiles/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=372.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/profiles/profile.php?prof=372</a> <br /> My full time post is Headteacher of Highfurlong School, Blackpool. I&#39;m the teacher responsible for ICT and PE. This specialist work has been described as best practice and outstanding. The new 2004 school web site and prospectus illustrates this. I have won the North West Teaching Award and last year became a Farmington Fellow, Harris Manchester College, Oxford.  </p><p> Here I designed and produced the DARE eLearning project: online resources for assemblies, PSE and circle time. The NWLG have purchased the licence. It can be found in the KS1 and RE area.  I also write for national trade journals and run a media agency. </p><p> This page and the links have detailed <a href="http://www.plodicus.com/AboutUs2.htm">rationale</a> that you may wish to consider (over two thousand words).  </p><p> The <a href="http://www.highfurlong.blackpool.sch.uk/" target="_blank">work</a> we do using assistive technology has been rated as some of the best practice in the country.  </p><p> This work features on <a href="http://www.nwlg.org/pages/resources/highfurlong/" target="_blank">www.nwlg.org/pages/resources/highfurlong</a> </p><p> The NWLG have also bought the licence for the DARE project &ndash; as featured in the TES In November 2002.  </p><p> As stated before I am a Farmington Fellow &ndash; HMC, Oxford. In 2002 I was awarded the &lsquo;Teaching Trust&rsquo; NW SEN Teacher &lsquo;Plato&rsquo; award. I do lots of other things as well &ndash; special access technology reviews for teaching journals etc.  </p><p> <strong>New Scholars </strong></p><p> <strong>Steven Coombs</strong><br />  An overview of Dr Steven Coombs can be found on <a href="http://www.bathspa.ac.uk/about/profiles/profile-academic.asp?user=academic%5Ccoos5" target="_blank">personal and academic profiles</a> at the BSUC Website. </p><p> He is currently Head of CPD and Chair of the Professional Master&#39;s Programme at Bath Spa since August 2002.  Steven is in the throws of setting up a new Centre for Educational Innovation and Technology (CEIT) in partnership with MirandaNet.  MoU currently being negotiated, with mission to be given later. </p><p> Steven worked at Sonoma State University, CSU, California from July 2000 until Aug 2002, setting up a new Ed Tech Master&#39;s programme and also worked on the Digital Light Bridge authentic video project for teacher training website. </p><p> His interests and contributions include:<br /> Critical Thinking Scaffolds.<br /> Knowledge Elicitation Systems.<br /> Social Parity research ethics for action research/enquiry modes.<br /> Professional Development of teachers/trainers etc. </p><p> <strong>Anne Gould</strong><br /> <a href="../profiles/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=403.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/profiles/profile.php?prof=403</a><br /> I have recently taken up a post as E-Learning Consultant for UCST/ULT, a company which owns 9 independent schools and sponsors several City Academies.  My husband and I have been taken on primarily as trainers for staff in using the ACTIVboards and other technologies to enhance learning.  All the academies and schools have Promethean ACTIvboards in their classrooms as well as broadband internet access.  Some schools are also equipped with VC equipment. </p><p> <strong>Anthony Jones</strong><br />  For more than three decades Tony Jones has worked closely with teachers in exploring and evaluating various educational uses of digital technologies. A consistent theme has been the development, implementation and evaluation of strategies for using ICT with the goal of leading to better teaching and more effective learning. The majority of this research has been extremely practical in nature, has been school-based, and has been in the context of a specific school or curriculum area. </p><p> He was involved in the Sunrise School and the Navigator Schools projects, especially in creating and providing ongoing classroom based professional learning for teachers and pre-service teachers. Much of this teacher professional learning has concentrated on developing strategies for improving student numeracy and literacy through cooperative classroom use of ICT, and has covered all primary grade levels from Prep to Six and all curriculum key learning areas. </p><p> For many years Tony was at La Trobe University, and in 2003 moved to the Department of Science and Mathematics Education (incorporating IT in Education and Health and Physical Education) within the Faculty of Education at the University of Melbourne. In addition to teaching postgraduate subjects concerned with theories and practices of online learning, he has supervised research theses in this area. He is currently supervising a number of doctoral students, and a masters student who is investigating the effectiveness of selected modes of synchronous communication, especially web-based text chat and video-conferencing, in linking students with a chronic illness has are absent from school, with one of their teachers. </p><p> Tony is a trained teacher who has taught in both primary and secondary schools. He has an undergraduate degree in Pure Mathematics and a PhD that focused on an aspect of Educational Computing. </p><p> <strong>Edna Aphek</strong><br />  <a href="../profiles/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=402.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/profiles/profile.php?prof=402</a> </p><p> <strong>Jes Roddy</strong><br /> <a href="../profiles/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=401.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/profiles/profile.php?prof=401</a> </p><p> <strong>Mythili Ramchand</strong><br />  <a href="../profiles/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=398.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/profiles/profile.php?prof=398</a><br /> My interests in IT pertains to developing courseware/training classroom teachers for effective use of computers. Most schools in India (at least in Southern India) have been provided with computers - but their use is being limited to imparting computer skills to students. </p><p> <strong>Zhang Ming</strong><br />  <a href="../profiles/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=381.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/profiles/profile.php?prof=381</a> <br /> We hope to have a project to set up links with a college or university. That is to have some activities such as exchanging students, teachers and leaders with them.  </p><p>    Another thing I understand that Chinese teachers might be needed in your county. I would like to be a Chinese teacher in any school or college in your country even a far-away village or a little town for one year or half a year to enrich my teaching experience.

I am passionate about teaching adults with profound and complex learning disabilities, and have used the computer to write a 2 year syllabus, make all the materials, which are suitable for adults.

The decision follows positive feedback from the pilot of the &#39;Teachers TV&#39; service, which trialled 44 programmes during February and March. The service will initially launch on digital terrestrial and satellite television platforms, with discussions said to be ongoing with cable TV operators NTL and Telewest. With a budget of &pound;20 million per year, the channel will broadcast a mix of education news, classroom resources and training and development programming, as well as offering a number of interactive services allowing viewers to access further information onscreen. Some programmes will be available <a href="http://www.teachers.tv/" target="_blank">online</a> which will also provide links to online resources, discussions forums and lessons plans. See the 9 July <a href="http://www.egovmonitor.com/link?131e" target="_blank"> announcement</a>.  </p><p> Department for Education and Skills: Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners. The DfES has published its plan to fundamentally change the education system, which incorporates moves to give state education establishments greater freedoms to run their own affairs. Included in the document are a number of proposals on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in education. They include developing more integrated systems to facilitate better information sharing to assess children&#39;s needs; ICT to assess and support individualised teaching and learning; extending the government&#39;s commitment to investing in interactive whiteboards and handheld devices to support classroom teaching for the next five years, plus further development of ICT-based learning for adults.
