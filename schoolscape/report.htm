<p><strong><a name="ab"></a>Abstract</strong>: This short paper reports on the 
    initial work carried out by the schoolscape@future project, part of the EU 
    Minerva Action. The project explores the building of a vision for 21st century 
    schools where ICT is integrated into practice. The project creates models 
    of integrated and innovative ICT practice in schools, put forth by teachers, 
    school managers and industrial experts in three countries (Ireland, UK and 
    Portugal). The project seeks to build a networked knowledge between teachers, 
    researchers and industry through identifying, analysing, documenting and disseminating 
    not only innovative pedagogical practices using ICT but also effective school 
    organisation and management processes which use ICT. Two expert seminars have 
    been organised in each of the three participating countries and highlights 
    of the seminars and selections from the emerging database will be shown here.

  <p>This short paper reports on the initial work carried out by the schoolscape@future 
    project which is in its first year of a two-year study. The Minerva Action 
    seeks to promote European co-operation in the field of Open and Distance Learning 
    (ODL) and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in education and 
    this specific initiative explores a vision for 21st century schools in which 
    ICT is integrated into practice. Through working with successful schools, 
    the project creates models of integrated and innovative ICT practice, put 
    forth by teachers, school managers and industrial experts in three countries 
    (Ireland, UK and Portugal). The project builds a networked knowledge between 
    teachers, researchers and industry through identifying, analysing, documenting 
    and disseminating innovative pedagogical practices using ICT and effective 
    school organisation and management processes which use ICT. Two expert seminars 
    have been organised in each of the three participating countries and highlights 
    of the seminars and the emerging database will be shown here. The seminars 
    have been designed to involve policy makers, teachers and industry experts 
    so as to provide the opportunity to explore solutions to constraints in depth.</p>
  <p>The presentation will begin with a discussion of the aims of the project 
    and its relation to the overall goals of the Minerva initiative. The project 
    seeks to involve teachers and industry experts and this presentation will 
    feature a number of examples from the emerging database designed to brief 
    teachers on recent and emergent technologies. A selection of the Irish teacher 
    and industry experts will present work at ITTE with work of the other team 
    members to be presented at future conferences.</p>
  <p>Pat Seaver will introduce a pioneering Irish school and report on is use 
    of ICT specifically in school management. St Helens is a primary school in 
    Portmarnock, north County Dublin. The school caters for nearly 300 pupils 
    with a staff of 14 teachers. A vibrant and caring school, St Helens has earned 
    a reputation for innovation and good practice, especially in the areas of 
    learning support and use of ICT in education. An exemplar of best practice, 
    projects includes primary pupils digitally editing the schools video diary. 
    Having originally pioneered the use of thin-client networks for Irish primary 
    schools, the school decided to respond to the technical support problems of 
    other Irish schools. Using low-cost wireless loop technology, they have extended 
    their own local area network to another school some miles away. St Helens 
    wishes to further demonstrate the scalability of this technology by providing 
    six networked stations to all seven primary schools in their locality.</p>
  <p>Jim Kelly will next represent some of the industry-related initiatives with 
    an exploration of recent developments at Intel Ireland. He has designed web 
    simulations and explores their potential as effective learning solutions for 
    complex concepts. His work here will focus on a first-of-its-kind, innovative 
    web 3d simulation-learning solution pilot that accelerates understanding and 
    achievement of higher order thinking skills for plasma etch. Active learning 
    results in better longer-term recall, synthesis, and problem-solving skills 
    than learning by hearing, reading, or watching. We learn best from experience, 
    but we never directly experience the consequences of many of our most important 
    decisions. The key benefit of a web-based simulation beyond standard eLearning 
    (anytime, anywhere), is a learning-by-doing approach where learners can experiment 
    in a safe environment without risk of damaging equipment. The simulation demonstrated 
    here enables learners to discover principles, trends and relationships for 
    themselves. Crucially it demonstrates and visualises what happens inside equipment 
    (which cannot be achieved with a real piece of equipment). Learners are tutored 
    at their own pace for efficient and effective work through mastering the activities. 
  </p>
  <p>Mick Meehan will explore the use of an interactive whiteboard in the Irish 
    Armed Forces. The use of the Smart Board will also be explored in relation 
    to its potential in a number of learning environments. It will be argued that 
    interactive whiteboards can turn your computer and projector into a tool for 
    teaching, collaborating and presenting. With a computer image projected onto 
    the board, for example, you can press on the touch-sensitive surface to access 
    and control any application and you can work at the board to take notes and 
    highlight information. Interactive whiteboards help save time, increase interactivity 
    and improve in-class communication.</p>
  <p>Enda Donlon reviews a new ICT initiative, the Logos Project, as part of the 
    rather radical transformation of Religious Education. The new NCCA RE syllabus 
    is currently being introduced on a phased basis throughout the country. With 
    the introduction of this new syllabus, Teacher In-Service and In-Career Development 
    becomes a fundamental and undeniable necessity if a successful integration 
    is to take place. The Logos project is a joint venture between the In-Career 
    Development Unit of the Department of Education and Science, and the Mater 
    Dei Institute of Education, a prominent third level teacher training institute 
    in the field of Religious Education. Available to all teachers of this new 
    syllabus, Logos takes the form of a virtual learning environment, and is hosted 
    on the main www.materdei.ie server. Currently reaching the end of year two 
    of a three-year life expectancy, just under one third of all schools teaching 
    the new syllabus are registered for the project, and are &quot;logging onto 
    Logos&quot;. The aim of this presentation is to conduct an evaluation of the 
    project to date, by paying particular attention to a number of issues including 
    considering whether Information and Communications Technology is an appropriate 
    medium for the delivery of these resources. Also important is the question 
    addressed through the research methodologies of questionnaire and interview, 
    of finding out what teachers in the field really think of the project, and 
    paying particular attention to any suggestions and criticisms they may have, 
    in order to inform the final year of the project, and also the bigger picture 
    of similar ICD projects.</p>
  <p>This presentation will conclude with an outline of the future directions 
    of the Minerva schoolscape@future project including work being carried out 
    on ICT and identity and inclusive citizenship in the UK and also highlight 
    work of the Portuguese team. </p>
