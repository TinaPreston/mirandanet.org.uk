  <h3>Mary Rector, Pleasantville Elementary School, Iowa USA</h3>
  <p>Two years ago our school's technology coordinator came to me with an opportunity 
    that had been presented to her by our Area Education Agency. The AEA technology 
    coordinator had received an email from Marion Scott-Baker, a teacher from 
    Cheam School in Great Britain, looking for a first grade instructor to work 
    with. Marion was interested in pen pal activities plus technology activities 
    the two classrooms could share. From there I was given Marion's email address 
    and we began our correspondence. Through several emails we were able to set 
    up a plan of exchanges. The first year began with just a couple exchanges. 
    This past school year there were more exchanges and contact.</p>
  <p>We started the school year by sending a 'Meet Our Class' book which had photos 
    of each student and a few photos of our school and classroom. My students 
    did their first writing assignment, which was an introductory letter. They 
    were to include in this letter their name, age and something they liked to 
    do. The students' letters were then put together into a 'Hello Hug Book' and 
    mailed off to Cheam School.</p>
  <p>We, in turn, received an introductory book from Marion's class with an introduction 
    of each student. My class did graphing activities with the information they 
    enclosed about themselves. It was a great way to be introduced!</p>
  <p>It's hard to explain or put into words the excitement of my students when 
    we received our first mailing from Cheam. Right before our very eyes those 
    students became real to us! That excitement was there through each and every 
    project we sent as well as those we received.</p>
  <p>We tried to coordinate projects, themes, and units of study throughout the 
    school year, hoping to compliment each other's curriculum. My class studied 
    the life cycle of the butterfly as our first science theme. We shared the 
    life cycle of the monarch caterpillar with them by making an 'imovie' and 
    emailing it to their classroom. The movie was short but included each of the 
    stages as we witnessed them in our classroom caterpillar tank. We also showed 
    them how we released the butterflies once they emerged and their wings were 
    dry. </p>
  <p>Included in our first mailing from Cheam were questions about apples. This 
    was one of their first units of study. It fitted right in with our curriculum 
    because we also discuss the life cycle of the apple tree. We were able to 
    answer their questions, send them a photo book of our trip to an apple orchard, 
    and provide them with a storybook of information about apples from our region.</p>
  <p>My class learned about Guy Fawkes Day from the Cheam students. They shared 
    a literature book along with a 'class-made' book about their celebration. 
    My students and I were totally unfamiliar with the celebration. We were extremely 
    interested in this story and event. It was a great learning experience for 
    us all.</p>
  <p>Christmas brought a fun ornament project with a letter to the Cheam students 
    sharing holiday plans for our winter break.</p>
  <p>The largest project we shared with our Cheam pen pals was our research project 
    on penguins. My students were divided into groups with each group having to 
    research and find information about a specific type of penguin, collect data, 
    make a life-size model of their penguin, and make a presentation to the classroom. 
    The presentation was taped and sent along to Cheam along with a 'Penguin Fact' 
    class book, a penguin literature book that was a class favourite, and penguin 
    erasers. We were confronted with the problem of converting the tapes for viewing, 
    which ended up being quite costly. We're currently working on a solution to 
    that problem.</p>
  <p>Along about the same time, our Cheam pen pals created a video for us about 
    their school with interviews from each student as well as a few staff members. 
    What an enjoyment! My students sat spellbound listening and actually seeing 
    their pen pals in their school environment.</p>
  <p>One of our final projects came in the form of an email question from Cheam. 
    They requested information about our housing. They were beginning a unit of 
    study on homes. We did a special homework assignment that gathered data about 
    each student's home. We also did a writing project that shared some of the 
    information we gathered. We received back from Cheam information and history 
    about their homes with pictures. My students thought it particularly interesting 
    that their houses had names!</p>
  <p>We plan to continue our relationship into this next school year with hopes 
    of including our second grade classrooms. There is interest on both sides 
    to continue with exchanges. It has been a very fun and rewarding experience. 
    We're both hoping to include a bit more technology while adding some new projects!</p>
