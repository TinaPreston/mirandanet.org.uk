  <h2>Privacy and Spam Policy</h2>
  <p><a href="privacy.htm">Privacy Policy</a> | Spam Policy </p>
  <noscript>
  <p><strong>Anti-spam</strong>: this page contains email addresses which only
    show if you have JavaScript enabled</p>
  </noscript>
<p>MirandaNet's editor pursues as rigidly as possible a policy of disguising 
    email address on the site so that they can't be harvested by 'spam bots', 
    nasty versions of web crawlers which search web pages for valid email addresses. 
    Why should anyone want to do this, you might ask? There are two reasons, as 
    far as I know:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Finding valid email addresses to send spam to </li>
    <li> Finding valid email addresses to use when sending spam </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Each reason is equally obnoxious and objectionable. If you are unlucky enough 
    to have found your email address on a spammer's list, you will know that spam 
    can be at the very least a minor irritant, at worst, when it develops into 
    a torrent of nasty mail, a reason for not using email. That is why I try my 
    hardest to make sure that if your email address is on this site, it can't 
    be read by a harvester. You can test this by typing your email address into 
    Google or another search engine, and see if any reference to it appears with 
    reference to a MirandaNet page. If it does, please 
	  <script type="text/javascript"><!--
	  display("get in touch with me","editor","mirandanet.org.uk","My email address seems to be visible on MirandaNet")
	  // -->
	  </script>
    with the details and I will put it right.</p>
  <p><strong>Why you might have been 'spammed' by MirandaNet</strong></p>
  <p>The second reason is possibly more disturbing. Recently I have received numerous 
    'Delivery Failure' emails purporting to refer to messages that I have sent 
    which cannot be delivered for a number of reasons - 'mail box full' is one 
    common reason, but 'no such address' is by far the commonest. One recent batch 
    had about 100 randomly generated AOL email addresses that I had apparently 
    been trying to contact. Goodness knows how many more actually got through, 
    and I shudder to think what these people made of the messages that your humble 
    and honest Editor was apparently sending them. </p>
  <p>What these people are doing is doubly illegal and immoral: improper use of 
    someone else's email address, <strong>and</strong> sending unsolicited email, 
    but it seems there is nothing that one can do about this. Certainly one should 
    never respond to spam, as this only confirms that the email address is real 
    and it will no doubt get used with greater frequency. I can only apologise 
    to anyone who has received a message purporting to come from me or from other 
    MirandaNet addresses, or indeed any other domain names that I am associated 
    with.</p>
  <p><strong>What can you do?</strong></p>
  <p>There are two things you can do to check that you have not been spammed by 
    MirandaNet:</p>
    <p>One is to look at the 'Header' of the message. In Outlook and Outlook Express 
      you right click on the item before you open it and choose <strong>Options</strong>, 
      or if you have already opened the item you can click on <strong>View</strong> 
      then <strong>Options</strong>. The Header will have all sorts of information 
      telling you where it came from, including the original sender. Unless this 
      is Xilo, our ISP, it won't have come from us. Most of the recent batches 
      have apparnetly been from an outfit in Italy or The Netherlands. I say 'apparently', 
      because spammers prefer to fake just about everything in their messages.</p>
  <p>Another is to look us up on a spam list. There are several of these around, 
    but the one I use most is at <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/">www.dnsstuff.com</a> 
    where you can put our domain name (mirandanet.org.uk) into a spam database 
    and check for yourself. You need to interpret the results with care, as not 
    every listing indicates spamming. Sometimes you will see a highlight because 
    of server error, or missing 'reverse DNS', none of which means spam. </p>
  <p>We did once appear genuinely though incorrectly on one of these lists and 
    some people did have their MirandaLink mail blocked. That was when our ISP 
    was using a different Virtual Server, and someone else on the same server 
    had what is called an '<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/open_relay.html">Open 
    Relay</a>' which is capable of sending mail from a different server. Needless 
    to say, MirandaNet has no such Open Relay. Web Editors who are interested 
    in this topic will understand when I say we <strong>don't</strong> have <a href="http://www.scriptarchive.com/formmail.html">Matt's 
    Formmail</a> on the site either (read all about it, but <strong>please don't 
    use</strong> - get the better version from <a href="http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/scripts.shtml">nms</a>, 
    which even Matt recommends on his own site), although would-be spammers try 
    to find it on an almost daily basis. Many sites will tell you about the vulnerability 
    of Matt's Formmail: <a href="http://www.mailvalley.com/formmail/">follow 
    this link</a> for a <a href="http://www.mailvalley.com/formmail/">typical</a> 
    one; and <a href="http://www.linuxexposed.com/Articles/Hacking/The-FormMail-Hack-Explained-2.html">follow 
    this link</a> for an article telling you <a href="http://www.linuxexposed.com/Articles/Hacking/The-FormMail-Hack-Explained-2.html">how 
    to block attacks</a>.</p>
  <p>On a recent check of the<a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/"> 
    DNS Stuff</a> spam list I found that one private lister has our URL listed
    because we have no listed 'abuse' email address. While this is strictly true,
    all the .ac.uk addresses have a generic abuse address:
    abuse at ja.net. </p>
  <p>Please <a href="contact.htm">contact</a> us if you have any questions about 
    this policy and other matters to do with spam or privacy on the web.</p>
