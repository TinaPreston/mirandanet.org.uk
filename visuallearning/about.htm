  <p>This article can also be <a href="Visual_Learning_Evidence.doc">downloaded
    as a Word document</a> (32KB)</p>
  <p>This exploration of the ways in which Visual Learning can work draws from
      a number of concepts: first, and most importantly, what we understand of
      the structure of the structure of the brain, synapses and cortical memory.
      The concept of plasticity, and the ways in which the brain develops and
      changes as a result of input, is another. The developing understanding
      of mirror neurons and their importance to learning also contributes to
      this exploration. Most importantly, it is underpinned by our understanding
    of learning and its developmental stages.</p>
  <p> Learning can be seen as a mental function that relies on the acquisition
      of knowledge (of different types and range) that is grounded in information &#8211; whether
      specific or perceived. What is learned is used as the basis of further learning,
      skills, values, belief systems, ideologies and competences. The visual learning
      process is one that can be seen to underpin other processes of learning (cf.
    Ostensiveness: Piaget, 1953<sup><a href="#01" id="fn1" title="see footnote">1</a></sup>).</p>
  <p> The assumptions that follow are drawn from current thinking about the relationships
      between what we see, what we remember and what we know. They help to explain
      why visual learning may be important, and how a range of technologies may
    contribute to these processes.</p>
  <h3> What Science suggests</h3>
  <p> Connections in the brain are constantly changing: they are not hardwired<sup><a href="#02" id="fn2" title="see footnote">2</a></sup>.
        The synapses relating to vision peak at around 10 months. The density
        of these synapses then declines and stabilises around 10 years of age.
        It
        is the pattern, however, rather than the number of connections that is
        most
        important. In terms of cognitive development there are &#8216;windows of
        time&#8217; in the developing brain: critical periods for neural connections
    and pathways<sup><a href="#03" id="fn3" title="see footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
  <p> The concept of plasticity is relevant here, in terms of the ways in which
        organisms adapt to environmental stimulus &#8211; in particular the brain,
        and the ways in which it adapts to stimuli<sup><a href="#04" id="fn4" title="see footnote">4</a></sup>. Plasticity refers to the ways
        in which brain structures can change to better cope with the environment:
        neurons or synapses can change their internal parameters in response to inputs
    and stimuli. The theory of neuroplasticity (Shaw &amp; McEachern, 2001)<sup><a href="#05" id="fn5" title="see footnote">5</a></sup>describes
      the ways in which thinking, learning, and acting actually change both the
    brain's physical structure and functional organization from top to bottom.</p>
  <p> Within the cortex, one region looks different from another, not because
        the function is different, but because of what it is connected to. However, all
        cortical regions perform a common function or algorithm.<sup><a href="#06" id="fn6" title="see footnote">6</a></sup>
		Vision is no different from hearing, which is no different from motor output. Cortical
        connections across the different regions of the cortex are genetically determined.</p>
  <h3> What does this mean for Visual Learning?</h3>
  <p> The stimuli that come from the senses of sight and hearing are not the
          same, although there is a similarity in the way in which the cortex
        processes the
          signals. Therefore the cortex is dividing itself into task-specific
        functional areas long into childhood. The importance of plasticity is
        that the wiring
          of the neurocortex can change and rewire itself. The brain regions
        develop specialised functions based on information flowing in during
        the process
    of development.</p>
  <p> The sequence can be <strong>simplified</strong> as:</p>
  <p> <em>Visual information &raquo; optic nerve fibres &raquo; thalamus &raquo; primary
    visual cortex</em></p>
  <p> These inputs from visual information are converted: the inputs become
            neural signals. These neural signals act as &#8216;action potentials&#8217;, or
    spikes, and are partly chemical and partly electrical.</p>
  <p> Each set of patterns is experienced differently, but the input to
              the brain is no different for visual, aural, sensual, motor signals
              or
      stimuli.</p>
  <h3> Is Visual Learning more powerful?</h3>
  <p> Vision relies on both spatial and temporal patterns, which are constantly
            changing over time, unless we simply look at unmoving object, with
            no change in either the lighting or our own position. The visual
            input is
            more likely,
            therefore, to generate a greater number of &#8216;action potentials&#8217; than
            other stimuli, although it could be argued that music can have a similarly
            rich set of potentials.<br>
      The processes through which memory leads to recall are based on pattern
            sequences and temporal or spatial patterns recreated from partial
            versions of pattern
            sequences known as invariance. These invariant forms are stored in
            the cortical memory and reconstructed.    </p>
  <h3>Cortical memory</h3>
  <p> The reconstruction of visual memory within the cortex can be represented
    as:</p>
  <p> Storing sequences &raquo; auto-associative recall &raquo; predictive ability
    &raquo; Invariant representations</p>
  <h3> Interactivity</h3>
  <p> Changes in input	&raquo;	increases in range of predictive ability</p>
  <p> (Cf. Visual technologies in classrooms)</p>
  <p> Predictive behaviours and abilities are based on prior behaviour
                  and experience &#8211; for
                  example, the progression from Concrete through to Abstract thinking
    (Piaget). These can be termed invariant representations.</p>
  <h3> Imagination</h3>
  <p> If we consider the way in which imagination works &#8211; &#8220;&#8230; seeing
                    pictures in my head &#8230;&#8221; as one child said &#8211; then
                    the process that we use for making predictions is reversed to produce
    neural inputs. </p>
  <p> Predictive output	&raquo;	reversed	=	inputs</p>
  <p> In this way the visualisation process is used for performative
                      preparation, for example, by athletes, technicians, craft
                      workers, artists and
                      so on. The act of visualising a routine, an action or a
        process enables an individual
                      to mentally rehearse and prepare for a performance, to
        the extent that
                      there is a kinaesthetic impact: visualising prepares the
                      body for action, so to
    speak.</p>
  <h3> The Mind</h3>
  <p> And as for the Mind, it&#8217;s what the Brain does &#8230;</p>
  <h4> Changing performance: the role of Mirror Neurons</h4>
  <p> Mirror neurons are a class of nerve cells in areas of the
                            brain. They relay signals for planning movement and
        carrying it out.
                            The mirror
                            system is
                            activated when specific actions are watched, even
        concentrating on a separate task
                            (Muthukumaraswamy<sup><a href="#07" id="fn7" title="see footnote">7</a></sup>,
							Muthukumaraswamy, 2007<sup><a href="#08" id="fn8" title="see footnote">8</a></sup>). Motor systems in the brain
          are activated when a person observes an action being performed:
                            it suggests
                            that we understand
                            and learn to imitate the actions of others through
        these brain mechanisms. Mirror neurons therefore reveal how
    children learn.</p>
  <p> Mirror neurons fire in response to chains of actions
                              linked to intentions. They then provide a template
            for the individual
                              to
                              replicate, a model
      for analysis of others and for prediction.</p>
  <p> Mirror neurons provide clues to how children learn:
                            they are active from birth (Meltzoff, 2007<sup><a href="#09" id="fn9" title="see footnote">9</a></sup>).
                            This suggests
                            that human
                            children
                            are &#8216;hard-wired&#8217; to
                            learn through imitation, with their mirror neurons
                            involved in observing, and then practicing. Earlier
                            studies &#8211; the theory of Observational
                            Learning (Bandura, 1986<sup><a href="#10" id="fn10" title="see footnote">10</a></sup>) suggest that an observer&#8217;s
                            behaviour changes after viewing the behaviour of
                            a model. Findings from research
                            into mirror
                            neurons provides additional support for the Observational
                            Learning hypothesis, which was often typified as
                            simply constructed from causal
                            connections. In
                            fact, observation directly improves muscle performance
                            via mirror neurons. By watching a game, a performer
                            will be better able to predict
                            what will
                            happen next. It may well be that the Nintendo wii
                            captures and extends this process.</p>
  <h3> Re-defining interactivity</h3>
  <p> For the past ten years the term &#8217;interactive whiteboard&#8217; has
                              produced discussion and dissent, with a significant group of educationalists
                              and researchers expressing concern that the technology did not, in fact,
                              appear to lead to a shift in pedagogy on the part of users &#8211; and that
                              the technology seemed to reinforce traditional modes of pedagogy, rather
                              than those considered &#8216;interactive&#8217; (Moss et al, 2007<sup><a href="#11" id="fn11" title="see footnote">11</a></sup>)
    . </p>
  <p> It may be helpful, however, to reconsider the notion
                              of interactivity in the context of technology use,
                              and see
                              it in terms of
                              the interaction between
                              the visual objects and the ways in which these
                              are processed. Changes in input, the ways in which
                              mirror
                              neurons process
                              the inputs and
                              the impact
                              on memory and imagination, may be more significant
    than the preferred pedagogical approach of a teacher.</p>
  <p> Indeed, consideration should be given to the ways
                              in which the physical configuration of the learning
                              environments &#8211; ambient lighting, the effects of various
                              colour combinations, and so on &#8211; and the impact that these
    have on individuals.</p>
  <h3> Implications for Education: why Visual Learning
    is powerful</h3>
  <p> Vision relies on both spatial and temporal patterns.
                              These patterns are constantly changing over time.
                              This visual
                              input therefore
                              generates a greater number
    of &#8216;action potentials&#8217; than other stimuli (e.g., aural).</p>
  <p> The use of visual display technologies provides
                              an easy focus for learners. By the visual sequencing
                              of a learning
                              process
                              mirror
                              neurons can be
                              fired &#8211; and
                              the sequence then replicated, modelled and applied to other contexts &#8211; a
                              powerful reinforcement in mathematics education, for example. This
                              works in two main ways: first, digital representations can be replayed
                              until the
                              learner can see the range of models and their possible permutations;
                              second, the mirror neuron effect enables the learner to replicate
                              and reproduce them
    to demonstrate understanding and application.</p>
  <p> When we talk about interactivity (as, for example,
                              with interactive whiteboards), the concept of interactivity
                              should not necessarily
                              be predicated solely
                              in terms of the human actors. It is much more between
                              the learner and the display &#8211; and the ways in which there are constantly changing visual
    inputs, and therefore more &#8216;action potentials&#8217;.</p>
  <p> These changes in input produce increases in the
                              range of visual memory, predictive ability and
                              in the visualisation
                              process,
                              with mirror
                              neurons an integral
    part of the process..</p>
  <p> It should be stressed, however, that there are
                              innate differences in perception: whilst a number
                              of observers
                              witness the
                              same events, neither
                              the &#8216;action
    potentials&#8217; or the outcomes are necessarily identical. </p>
