    <p><strong>NB: this is the MirandaNet Archive Site! Do not try to join here!</strong></p>
    <p>*****</p>
    <p>To join MirandaNet please go to the joining routine on the <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/">new 
      MirandaNet site</a>.</p>
    <p>*****</p>
    <p>We are always pleased to welcome new members to MirandaNet. All members 
      receive MirandaNews, a membership newsletter which generally goes out once 
      a month, occasionally more frequently. Members can also send and receive 
      messages on <a href="mirandalink.htm">MirandaLink</a> and debate 
      issues in our <a href="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/phorum/default.php">Forums</a>, and Scholars and 
      Fellows can <a href="listing.php.html">publish further information 
      about themselves</a> on the site as well as contribute to our <a href="../casestudies/index.html">Case 
      Studies</a>. Membership is free to bona fide educationists, but we ask for 
      support from members representing companies and educational industries.</p>
    <p>You can read more about these different kinds of members below, or go straight 
      to our Joining Form where you can apply for Membership.</p>
  <h3><a name="members" id="members"></a>Members</h3>  
    <p> MirandaNet members - the first level of participation. Members can subscribe 
      to the internal mail list to join in debates on ICT topics with other educators, 
      receive the latest news and the e-zine. Members are invited to all the MirandaNet 
      workshops, seminars, forums and conferences, are to use the World Ecitizens 
      and Ejournal sites. Members have access to additional features on the site 
      when they are logged in, such as additional publications, archives, the 
      forum, and email links to other members.</p>
    <p>You can join the MirandaNet Fellowship as a Member or Scholar depending 
      on how much you want to put in and how much you plan to gain from membership. 
      In particular we aim to reward what you already know and can do rather than 
      inventing new hurdles for you to jump. We also want to celebrate any skills 
      and knowledge you have in ICT which we may not even have guessed at yet. 
      Any comments on improving our inclusive and celebratory membership strategy 
      will be warmly received. Groups and young learners are welcome as well. 
      A group has the status of a MirandaNet chapter. There are already 25 international 
      MirandaNet chapters.</p>
    <p>When you complete the joining form we ask for contact information which 
      is not published on the site. We must have a valid email address as this 
      is our only way of contacting you normally. Unless you tell us otherwise, 
      your email address is included in the Newsletter which welcomes you to MirandaNet 
      so other members can contact you directly. 
      <!-- 
      Here is a diagram of how we see this working in our e-community (hotspot 
      here)-->
      <em><a href="join.htm">Apply now</a> (Go to <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/">mirandanet.ac.uk</a> 
      to join on our new site!)</em></p>
  <h3><a name="scholars" id="scholars"></a>Scholars</h3>
    <p>Scholars enjoy all the Member advantages, but will normally have submitted 
      at least 200 words about their ICT interests and practice in their Membership 
      Profile. This first profile that you have written will be sent to the newsletter 
      editor, so that it can be used to introduce you to other members. The editor 
      will discuss this introduction with you if you wish. If your first language 
      is not English you can send us notes which we will edit with pleasure. Scholars 
      must publish their submission in their profile which is posted online. <em><a href="join.htm">Apply 
      now</a> (Go to <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/">mirandanet.ac.uk</a> 
      to join on our new site!)</em></p>

  <noscript>
  <p><strong>Anti-spam</strong>: this page contains email addresses which only
    show if you have JavaScript enabled</p>
  </noscript>
    <p>We award a Fellowship to any Member or Scholar who writes a lengthier submission 
      or a multimedia equivalent about the ICT work that you specialise in, especially 
      a project. This article will be published via the Profile page (you need 
      to <a href="../membership/index.php.html">log in</a> for this) on the <a href="../casestudies/index.html">MirandaNet 
      Case Studies</a>; some items fit in better as a site feature, or on our 
      publications page, and the editor will discuss with you the best place and 
      format for publication if you like. These are the kinds of submissions you 
      can make: research notes of work in progress for comments and suggestions, 
      discussion papers about related topics, contributions to the MirandaNet 
      ICT in education literature review, academic research papers summarised 
      for practitioners, reviews of related books, software and other media, summaries 
      of uses of ICT education. A word count of around 2,000 words presents a 
      standard formula to help potential Fellows with length, but we are keen 
      to accept contributions of varying lengths and in other media as well. Abstracts 
      of 200/300 words of suggested contributions for the Ejournals will help 
      us to help you. See the current list of <a href="../casestudies/index.html">Case Studies</a> 
      for guidance. If you have any further questions about the Fellowship or 
      the profiles, please discuss them with Christina Preston by sending her 
      an email (

      ). <em><a href="join.htm">Apply now</a> (Go to <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/">mirandanet.ac.uk</a> 
      to join on our new site!)</em></p>
  <p>We also offer accreditation for practice-based research project at any level 
    from Diploma to Masters from the <a href="../research/academy.htm">MirandaNet 
    Academy</a>.</p>
    <h3><a name="associates" id="associates"></a>Associates</h3>
    <p>The Fellowship also has associates and partners from industry. These are 
      companies involved in research projects using advanced technologies for 
      teaching and learning. Industry sponsors are able to pilot new products 
      and services using the expertise of the Fellows in education. <em><a href="join.htm">Apply 
      now</a> (Go to <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/">mirandanet.ac.uk</a> 
      to join on our new site!)</em></p>
    <h3><a name="nuisances" id="nuisances"></a>Free Advertising</h3>
    <p>Some people try to join just to get some free advertising. This always 
      fails, except that the advertised site might get listed in my '<a href="nuisances.htm">blacklist</a>' 
      of sites that should be avoided.</p>
