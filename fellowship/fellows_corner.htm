  <p>Lawrence Williams writes about a ground-breaking collaborative educational

    and teachers in practical scientific work. The <a href="../ftp/New_ICT_Learning_Model.doc">New 
    Learning Model</a> (Word) aims to integrate the use of a number of ICT tools 
    (the web, email, JPEG files, spreadsheets, PowerPoint, digital cameras, video-conferencing 
    equipment) into a coherent learning framework. This learning process and the 
    use of ICT tools starts and ends with the web, forming a dynamic cycle of 
    activity. The New Learning Model is actually content-free, (i.e. it is applicable 
    to any curriculum subject) and the scientific content of this project was 
    provided by Bristol University NASA. </p>
