  <p>Brian asked me to write about the benefits of membership of MirandaNet. At 
    first this seemed straight forward but gradually I realised this was not a 
    simple request. MirandaNet is totally unlike any other online community I 
    know of. </p>
  <p><strong>Background<br>
    </strong>Perhaps some background would be in order. MirandaNet celebrated 
    its tenth birthday last Christmas which means it has been in existence almost 
    as long as the Internet. Members are spread across the world. There are MirandaNet 
    members in South America, the United States, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic 
    among others. MirandaNet has used the Internet as its standard form of communication 
    almost since its inception both with email and conferencing. Members also 
    meet online and in the flesh but this is not what makes MirandaNet so unusual. 
    The key to the organisation is the Fellowship system, where Fellows originate 
    (and) what they do. Fellows are drawn from all sectors of education, from 
    government organisations and most importantly, from industry. As important, 
    MirandaNet is based very firmly in the understanding that there is no such 
    thing as a free lunch. The organisation recognise(s)s that businesses exist 
    to make a profit but that also industrialists are as altruistic as the next 
    person. It also recognises that there seems to be a certain species of educator 
    around with a very big curiosity bump. The former of these two factors goes 
    against the opinion that seemed at one time to be widely held among teachers 
    that computer companies ought to give things to education simply because it 
    was a good and worthy thing to do and anyway computer companies were very 
    rich and could afford to do so. This is not of course necessarily true - companies 
    exist to make profits for their share holders and there is no obvious benefit 
    for a company to give things away. Companies such as Oracle or Microsoft are 
    the exception here, and that it probably because of the singular vision of 
    their leaders.</p>
  <p> The fellowship system in MirandaNet however allows these factors to inter-operate 
    to the benefit of all and allows companies to become profitably altruistic. 
    Perhaps some concrete examples would serve to illustrate the kind of thing 
    MirandaNet gets involved in and how this operates.</p>

  <p><strong><a name="lt"></a>Laptops</strong><br>
    The original project with which I was involved happened in 1995. MirandaNet 
    and Toshiba got together to see what would happen if you gave teachers laptops. 
    At the time this was a very radical idea indeed. Toshiba provided the laptops, 
    paid the cost of an online training course for the scholars (as we were called) 
    and also paid for some conference time. A lot of people were interested in 
    the findings and it is probably no surprise that NCET as was then sponsored 
    a larger scale project based on the MirandaNet findings. The spin-offs for 
    the scholars were numerous. We had suddenly been plunged into a very different 
    world from the narrow horizons of our individual schools. We found that we 
    actually knew more than some of the experts. We were even asked to write chapters 
    for books. Now anything seemed possible - eight years on and everyone involved 
    in that original project is now a significant figure, to a greater or lesser 
    extent, in the world of ICT. It comes as a pleasurable shock to be told you 
    are regarded as an expert in your given field! For Toshiba the benefits were 
    equally obvious. They gained an edge in a very competitive market, made useful 
    connections and were well placed when the NCET project went ahead. Toshiba 
    are still involved with MirandaNet and a current scholar is using laptops 
    provided by Toshiba in a project with disaffected children. Clearly Toshiba 
    would not have made this commitment unless they felt they were getting value 
    for money while the teacher concerned is being enabled to carry out some exciting 
    action research which will both be of a wider benefit to the profession as 
    well as furthering their own professional development.</p>
  <p>[<a href="#top">Back to the top</a>]</p>
  <p><strong><a name="iwb"></a>Interactive Whiteboards<br>
    </strong>MirandaNet is presently involved in a number of projects, two of 
    which seem of particular personal relevance to myself. The first is a partnership 
    with Promethean. In return for an extended training package a number of schools 
    are carrying out action research on best practice with whiteboards. It is 
    obvious what Promethean will get from this but it is also adding a tremendous 
    amount to the general knowledge base surrounding interactive whiteboards -surely 
    a worthwhile thing in itself. The teachers doing the research can also, if 
    they wish, use the research towards a professional qualification.</p>
  <p>[<a href="#top">Back to the top</a>]</p>
  <p><strong><a name="il"></a>International Links<br>
    </strong>The second project involves the face to face side of MirandaNet which 
    I feel is particularly worthwhile. One of the stated aims of MirandaNet, set 
    out by its founders, Christina Preston and Dr Boba Manova, was to foster international 
    peace and understanding. MirandaNet tries to reach out to teachers across 
    the world and link them together through shared projects. Lawrence Williams 
    from Holy Cross Convent School has long had a connection with a Japanese school 
    and Japanese teachers have been guests in London as a result of this. Visits 
    to other countries to see how their education system operates have been fascinating 
    and humbling. MirandaNet hosted a conference in Prague sponsored by Oracle 
    (not Apple) which inspired the English teachers with what they saw in the 
    Czech schools. On very little money and with limited resources these schools 
    were producing an education to rival and perhaps exceed our own. One school 
    delivered the whole curriculum based around the theme of art and their results 
    were stunning. The fact that the Czech Republic did not have a rigorous national 
    curriculum might have been linked to this or perhaps I'm just cynical. </p>
  <p>[<a href="#top">Back to the top</a>]</p>
  <p><strong><a name="bc"></a>British Council<br>
    </strong>Currently, MirandaNet is building links with China. At a meeting 
    sponsored by Actis and Promethean in January MirandaNetters met with teachers 
    from Beijing whose visit had been sponsored by the British Council. The Chinese 
    teachers gave impressive presentations about their schools and I hope that 
    many friendships were started. It was over whelming to see how much the Chinese 
    teachers thought we could offer them while we in turn were impressed by the 
    cultural wealth they were offering us. It is already clear to those of us 
    present at the presentation that Chinese schools, in Beijing at least, are 
    exceptionally well equipped though with huge (fifty plus) classes. The Chinese 
    also have a very different and distinct curriculum which reflects their culture. 
    Knot tying for instance is a regular lesson (knots have meanings) in at least 
    one school.</p>
  <p>[<a href="#top">Back to the top</a>]</p>
  <p><strong><a name="mn"></a>MirandaNetters<br>
    </strong>The kind of person who gets involved in MirandaNet is a topic for 
    discussion in itself. They tend, I think, not to be &#8216;fine detail&#8217; 
    types but rather people with a wider visionary sweep. They are also intensely 
    passionate yet realistic and recognise the barriers they face in their day 
    to day struggle to push the envelope of ICT. They all, without exception, 
    seem to have a huge sense of humour and a rebellious streak which likes bursting 
    pomposity. It may or may not be significant that members who started with 
    MirandaNet in the late 1990s as class room teachers are now HMIs, Head teachers, 
    professors, consultants and company directors. Others are now playing a part 
    in such think tanks as the BCS Schools Expert Working Panel. There is also 
    a fairly even balance of the sexes.</p>
  <p>Over the years I have been involved I have never ceased to be amazed at the 
    wealth of creativity and ideas that MirandaNet members provide and I am convinced 
    this is only possible because it does not follow a traditional narrow pathway. 
    It is not just academic, it is pragmatic and it is idealistic. It provides 
    confidence to its members because they know that if they personally do not 
    have the answer, someone in the community will. The attitude is also very 
    much that &#8216;just because no one else has done it does not mean it is 
    impossible&#8217;. </p>
  <p>[<a href="#top">Back to the top</a>]</p>
  <p><strong><a name="gi"></a>Get Involved<br>
    </strong>Finally, if you do get involved and find yourself invited to a MirandaNet 
    meeting the following are essential facts to understand:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> 
      <div> All meetings operate on <em>Tina Time</em>.</div>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <div> No one knows what is going on or how anything will be accomplished.</div>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <div> Everything does go on and is accomplished.</div>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <div> All meetings begin on the edge of a mental cliff and proceed forwards 
        from that point.</div>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <div> No one knows who will pay for it all.</div>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <div> Someone will pay your expenses &#8211; eventually.</div>
    </li>
  </ul>
