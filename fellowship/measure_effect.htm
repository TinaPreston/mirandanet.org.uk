  <p><em>During April 2006 there was a fascinating debate on the impact of ICT 
    on achievement and learning. The debate was started in the NAACE discussion 
    lists, but it was very quickly picked up by MirandaNet members on <a href="mirandalink.htm">MirandaLink</a>. 
    The simplistic notion that the only significant impact of ICT that we ought 
    to be measuring was very quickly kicked into touch by the membership, who 
    contributed some extremely pertinent observations to the debate.</em> </p>

    being measured?</a> | <a href="#observations">Observations</a></p>
  <h3> E<a name="evidence"></a>vidence from the classroom</h3>
  <p> <strong>The use of ICT promotes achievement</strong><br>
    ICT reaches the parts that other forms of education can&#8217;t. I have children 
    on my Gifted and Talented ICT list who have no achievements in any other subjects. 
    They are motivated to work independently and are happier children as a result 
    of this. </p>
  <p> <strong>Improved achievement</strong><br>
    Some reading scores have increased over 4 grade levels from their previous 
    year's test scores. Overall, my students showed increased motivation.</p>
  <p> Additionally, many of their previous years' teachers were so surprised at 
    how the kids were so motivated by ICT. Many special education teachers in 
    the U.S. don't use that much technology in their classroom. </p>
  <p> Regarding the classroom curriculum based assessments, reading software programs 
    such as Scholastics READ180 http://teacher.scholastic.com/products/read180/ 
    have helped. Before learning of READ180, I would tape record each student 
    reading then code their reading patters (e.g. prosody, phonemic awareness, 
    fluency) and adjust their curriculum accordingly. I hope someday students 
    and teachers will be able to chose various software together. </p>
  <p><strong> Individualised learning</strong><br>
    Furthermore, I've found that often ICT saves me time! In conclusion, I've 
    found some similarities between ICT with both students with special needs 
    and gifted kids, in that, ICT motivates and inspires our students. For teachers, 
    ICT helps teacher tailoring more individualized curriculum (thereby leading 
    to increased test scores) as well as motivates and inspires us. </p>
  <p><strong> Pupils manage their own learning</strong><br>
    Typically when special education teachers think of technology their schema 
    is focused on assistive technology. Whereas, when cyberkids (including students 
    with special needs) think of technology they see the wide possibilities of 
    ICT. ICT has helped in this process. Hence, I use ICT with my informal curriculum 
    based classroom assessments and include that in the portfolios. Next year, 
    if I teach students with special needs again I've decided that I will be using 
    e-portfolios upon seeing the technology at a recent conference. </p>
  <p> In the project I'm currently working with in Wolverhampton, children are 
    equipped with their own ICT including sketching, animation, sound, still photo 
    and video recording facilities (for example) which are available to them every 
    minute, whether they are at home or at school. For the teacher, this fund 
    of material was available as a source of further work to extend the children's 
    learning - and editing, assembling and presenting it was an obvious set of 
    follow-up activities.</p>
  <h3>I<a name="ict"></a>CT and Learning</h3>
  <p> ICT provides a learning experience in and of itself. Learners are constantly 
    trouble-shooting, applying the technology to new contexts and solving problems. 
    The Bricolage they apply to create work is a demonstration of skills, understanding 
    and concept development. </p>
  <p> Bridget Somekh&#8217;s latest work, <a href="../publications/research.htm">PELRS</a>, 
    talks about higher quality work rather than better results. </p>
  <p> 'Higher quality' learning appears to be much more in keeping with what teachers 
    believe in for their pupils / students. </p>
  <p> Teachers can then gauge individual growth. Also, I was thinking about student 
    motivation and gifted students. Are our gifted students bored or are they 
    engaged enough to stay in school?</p>
  <p> The real trick is to understand the new pedagogical opportunities that ICT 
    can help to lever. Thus, a different question needs to be asked, &#8220; what 
    new pedagogical opportunities does ICT help to enable in alternative learning 
    environments?&#8221; and &#8211; &#8220;What new curriculum opportunities 
    does ICT open up c.f. previous methods?&#8221; I really enjoy reading this 
    online discussion and am learning so much from everyone. Also, in my reflections 
    on ICT and learning, I've come to believe that there are many benefits via 
    ICT that are not testable...yet. For instance, when we look at cognition and 
    ICT we are still laying the groundwork. Here's a pop-media one from CNN that's 
    pretty interesting: </p>
  <p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/HEALTH/02/10/dyslexia.ap/index.html%20">http://www.cnn.com/2004/HEALTH/02/10/dyslexia.ap/index.html 
    </a></p>
  <p>The neural plasticity of children's brains are remarkable. Eventually teachers 
    and doctors will be able to collaborate more and target areas of the brain 
    that need further stimulus and development, and no doubt ICT will play a big 
    part in education of the future. </p>
  <h3> Q<a name="qualifications"></a>ualifications</h3>
  <p> Firstly ICT isn't 'merely a tool'. Secondly, ICT does/can define pedagogy. 
  </p>
  <p> The availability of so much ICT with the skills and ownership to utilise 
    it to the full places children in a significantly different relationship both 
    to their technologies and their learning. How should the teacher respond? 
  </p>
  <p> The pedagogy is in part driven by the technology and we have to work it 
    out. Whilst the children may be doing all of these things using technology, 
    they could just as well have played the games.</p>
  <h3>W<a name="measured" id="measured"></a>hat is being measured?</h3>
  <p> But how do we know or measure what effect ICT is having on achievement levels 
    in the rest of the curriculum? Technology alone will never change the RESULTS. 
    The results of integrated invisible technology, when assessed qualitatively 
    from the personal perceptions of the 'students ... and I also refer to teachers 
    here' show a SIGNIFICANT difference in the transformation of learning to learn 
    and my latest longitudinal research with pre-service teachers in traditional 
    and On-Line learning environments conclusively proves this point. Technology 
    enhanced learning environments which soulfully, meaningfully and responsibly 
    recognise the exceptional genius of all will show RESULTS beyond the traditional 
    ....</p>
  <p> It's significant that higher quality work and improved test scores and examination 
    results are not necessarily synonymous. </p>
  <p> If motivation is a common thread then what do we know about ICT and formative 
    assessment rather than summative? Do children build a wider portfolio or deeper 
    in particular areas? Just a thought! </p>
  <p> The omnipresent pencil or pen enables achievement within all areas of the 
    curriculum and similarly, ICT is merely another tool to enable achievement. 
    Alongside &#8216;Reading, Writing and Arithmetic&#8217; ICT is the fourth 
    &#8216;R&#8217; (though don&#8217;t know what &#8216;R&#8217; it would be!). 
    We regularly measure achievement of the 3 R&#8217;s through other areas of 
    the curriculum and similarly we are able to assess achievement of discrete 
    ICT skills within other subjects. Rigorous assessment of ICT capability, initially 
    as discrete skills within ICT lessons and subsequently within other areas 
    of the curriculum, provides evidence of progression of ICT achievement (or 
    regression). </p>
  <h3> O<a name="observations"></a>bservations</h3>
  <p> In this section MirandaNet members reflect on their experiences of using 
    ICT to facilitate learning.</p>
  <p> As a veteran of 23 years in the IT industry &#8211; just about the same 
    age as some of the engineers I work with &#8211; and an interest in learning 
    based ICT for about the same length of time, I have seen ICT based teaching 
    evolve from pretty picture/jolly sound based arithmetic drills through to 
    sophisticated network based environments linking schools across the globe. 
    In industry we have come to accept ICT as an inherent part of our working 
    environment. We do not question whether ICT is adding value, it is simply 
    &#8216;there&#8217;. </p>
  <p> I've learned to cherish my multicultural background and always question 
    education &quot;systems&quot; as a whole too&#8230;especially now that I'm 
    a teacher. Hunter/gather and high technology cultures are both products of 
    the neocortex. It is my contention that ICT naturally cultivates polymath 
    thinkers. Because ICT provides multiple perspectives, etc&#8230;that many 
    teachers and/or schools do not provide. How will the education of our young 
    affect future politics and world peace? How will ICT change our children&#8217;s 
    world? Also, a concluding thought...a great deal of the research that I find 
    related to ICT comes from the UK...both as a teacher and a scholar. </p>
  <p> ICT is merely a tool to enable human communication processes. ICT doesn&#8217;t 
    define or improve pedagogy in its own right &#8211; so the question is misguided. 
    Industry also accepts ICT as merely a tool to improve business activity and 
    I think education needs to take the same attitude and informed perspective. 
  </p>
  <p> Perhaps I should clarify what I was fully mean to say regarding ICT. Firstly, 
    I don't regard ICT is a singular tool, so yes, it certainly represents a range 
    of very different tools and applications across many fields, for which education 
    is but one. My perspective is looking at ICT, beyond the world of education, 
    in which people do not always regard ICT as associated with learning/pedagogy. 
    So yes, ICT can define pedagogy within educational applications. However, 
    this particular purpose of ICT is not always obvious to the wider society 
    of onlookers. </p>
  <p> The fact that ICT bends towards a skills based curriculum within the UK 
    suggests a lack of understanding of pedagogical application. I tend to view 
    the ICT tools as requiring first-order skills, by the users. I genuinely believe 
    that that context and purpose of ICT is not fully understood. Having said 
    that I fully support the project you are doing and welcome the potential benefits 
    for children's learning. The fact that we have a skills based assessment across 
    all curriculum fields (including ICT as a stand-alone subject) is the worrying 
    issue at stake. If the education system is to be impaled upon a skills-based 
    agenda then it will be very difficult to include deeper learning pedagogy 
    that embrace higher-order thinking and creativity. Sorry - meant to say 'content-heavy 
    curriculum for Primary children' (the Foundation stage curriculum is not). 
  </p>
  <p> Few schools have yet undertaken the systemic changes needed in order to 
    fully realise the transforming power of ICT (although there are many good 
    individual examples) </p>
  <p> No - so the pedagogies to support learning rigorously from such capabilities 
    have not been developed. </p>
  <p> Kress's Literacy in the New Media Age (2003) and Pahl &amp; Rowsell's Literacy 
    and Education: understanding the new Literacy Studies in the classroom (2005) 
    explore such issues. </p>
  <p> You can see some of my recent ICT work at <a href="http://www.cfkeep.org">http://www.cfkeep.org</a></p>
  <p> Web-based tools and networked information systems. To me this indicates 
    that if we want to stay in the same old teaching routines in 'pedagogical 
    isolation' in our classes and 'andragogical sterility', we ignore the role 
    of ICT tools in learning. If we don't enhance we are not supporting learners 
    to operate in an ICT enabled world and here I mean both teachers and students 
    as learners. We are also ignoring the potential of ICT to enhance ped-/andra-gogy.</p>
  <p> Great debate. I am enjoying learning from others' creative engagement, Sarah</p>
  <p> Thank you for sharing about <a href="http://www.notschool.net">Notschool.net</a>. 
    It is so encouraging to see as a special education teacher such a wonderful 
    program. Thanks for sharing.</p>
  <p> I wish I felt confident that the often-rash adoption of technology by many 
    teachers and schools, sweetened by political correctness, hadn't seriously 
    undermined that quintessentially human interaction. </p>
  <p> If you have limited time look at: Be Very Afraid 2 - the Background then 
    Capel le Ferne School Matching Green School and Ravensbourne College 1</p>
  <p> &quot;I wish I felt confident that the often rash adoption of technology 
    by many teachers and schools, sweetened by politically correctness, hadn't 
    seriously undermined that quintessentially human interaction&quot;. </p>
  <p> Completely agree with your comment about thought-less use of ICT. This relates 
    to my previous email about sharing 'better' usage of ICT that can raise achievement 
    among students (and teachers) in schools.</p>
  <p> I've really enjoyed reading this intellectual forum and am learning a lot. 
  </p>
  <p> There are teachers and schools that are innovative, compassionate, and want 
    the very best for their students. </p>
  <p> I am looking at teachers' research work with their students using web-based 
    templates from Bitterne Park School, Southampton. I would think that intellectually 
    stimulated teachers teach better too??? Thanks to Steve Coombs' Critical Thinking 
    Scaffolds we 'see' teachers learn. Look at <a href="http://www.teacherresearch.net/tr_cmcasestudy.htm">http://www.teacherresearch.net/tr_cmcasestudy.htm</a>
