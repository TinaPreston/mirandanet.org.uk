    <h3>MirandaNet Fellows presenting ICT CPD models at Naace</h3>
    <p><strong>From the MirandaNet Newsletter</strong><br>
      This year John Cuthell and I organised the ICT Continuing Professional
        Development (CPD) theme for the Naace conference that took place in Torquay
        this February. Naace, English professional association for those concerned
        with advancing education through the appropriate use of information and
        communications technology (ICT). About ten members of MirandaNet are
    also members of Naace.</p>
    <p> Some of the delegates followed our strand throughout. In the plenary
      they expressed a view about the use of ICT in schools which MirandaNetters
      will
      recognise. In the first place they cited key barriers
      in some schools as teachers&#8217; lack of time, poor technical support,
      the lack of effective ICT CPD programmes and assessment which does not
      value the impact of ICTs in learning. However, what they agreed overwhelmingly
      was that lack of vision for learning was the reason why the take up of
      ICT and results are still so poor in about 75% of schools. Communities
    of practice for professionals were seen as a key way of changing attitudes.</p>
    <p>Running
      this strand on ICT CPD was part of researching into the ICT CPD experience
      of the members of Naace, MirandaNet and ITTE. Our hypothesis
      here is that many people who are charged with teaching other teachers about
      ICT have had very little support themselves in any formal way. This is
    why communities of professionals like MirandaNet are so important. </p>
    <p>In the
      conference John and I were concentrating on the achievements we have seen
      in the use of practice-based research for whole school CPD. Richard
      Millwood opened the theme by talking about the practice-based ICT CPD models
      that he and Stephen Heppell used to run at Ultralab. Niel McLean, Becta,
      talked about multimodality and Vanessa Pittard, Becta, looked at the research
      that has been published about effective ICT CPD. Again, practice-based
      research came out very well. Tim Tarrant talked about Effective Models
      for ICT CPD with examples from UK teachers who joined him. Byron Evans,
      Adviser, RTU explained how teachers&#8217; communities have been developed
    in Northern Ireland based on project work. </p>
    <p>We also invited several senior
      managers and teachers from MirandaNet to present practice-based models
      that seem to be working in schools. You will
      find more about these presentations in the report: John Cuthell and Dai
      Thomas on ICT CPD &#8211; The MirandaNet Model: David Litchfield on Managing
      Information, Managing Change: Jane Finch, Primary adviser, There&#8217;s
      more to IT than just &#8216;getting someone in&#8217;, Mark Bennison, Vice
      Principal at Westminster Academy on Developing a Global Citizenship and
      Enterprise Agenda through ICT Underpinned CPD: Michael Smith, the Professional
      Development Coordinator, Forest School, Snaresbrook, who described his
      own CPD journey in ICT to bring out strategic issues and offer an opportunity
    for future thinking.</p>
    <p>The final presentation mentioned in the report is Roger
      Broadie&#8217;s
      project for Naace: Practically Transforming Learning, offers teachers a
      web space where they can go for instant information on running leading-edge
      practice based projects. We will be in touch with Fellows for support on
    building this knowledge base</p>
    <p>John Cuthell and I are currently working on
      the whole staff ICT CPD programmes with Westminster Academy, London and
      Castle View School, Sunderland. Teachers
      from both these schools came to Prague. Do get in touch with us if you
      would like us to advise on ICT CPD programmes in your school as well christina@mirandanet.ac.uk,
    john.cuthell@mirandanet.org.uk. </p>
    <h3>Naace Conference Report</h3>
    <p> The Naace Conference was held in Torquay from February 27 &#8211; March
      2 this year, with the theme: 20:20 Vision &#8211; The Future of ICT in
    Education &#8211; Clarity for the Present, Possibilities for the Next Decade.</p>
    <p>One
      of the strands of the conference was ICT CPD, managed by Christina Preston
      and John Cuthell, who were also engaged in researching Naace members&#8217; experiences
    of ICT CPD. </p>
    <p> <strong>Lead Presentation: Latest Research into Effective Pedagogy in ICT CPD</strong><br>
    Richard Millwood, formerly Director of Ultralab</p>
    <p> Richard&#8217;s session shared the progress made in the Naace/Ultralab
      DfES funded project to develop new continuing professional development
      approaches for teachers using inquiry-based learning, online community,
    patchwork assessment, exhibition and personalised learning.</p>
    <p> Contributions were made by a number of MirandaNet Members and Fellows.
      David Litchfield presented the first of the sessions. His theme was:</p>
    <p>      <strong>Managing Information, Managing Change</strong></p>
    <p>
      David Litchfield is the Headteacher of Castle View, Sunderland: Caroline
        McHale is Director of Business and Community Services at Castle View
        School.</p>
    <p>Senior
      managers face not only the developments of new technologies, but also the
      changing demands on information and communication. At Castle View
      School, the leadership group has been working to bring a coherent approach
      to development, monitoring and improvement by concentrating on the impact
      for the individual student. This session explored the approaches to student
      participation and individual learning that have driven the changes in information
    systems and the skills of the workforce.</p>
    <p><strong>John Cuthell ICT CPD &#8211; The
      MirandaNet Model</strong><br>
      John&#8217;s presentation looked at the MirandaNet model, and the ways
      in which members of the MirandaNet Community of Practice use it for their
      professional development. He outlined the ways in which the technologies
      of MirandaNet &#8211; the listserv, MirandaLink, the resources on the website,
      the Case Studies, the Discussion Forums and the working groups build a
      resource for the whole community. Not only that, but the resource is available
    to all, both nationally and internationally.</p>
    <p><strong>Evaluating ICT CPD Programmes</strong><br>
      Was the title of the presentation by Margaret Danby, Education Consultant
    and Mirandanet Fellow.</p>
    <p>The essential features of effective CPD evaluation
        were described and illustrated with examples of lessons learned about
        what promotes and what impedes effective
      CPD, drawn from previous various evaluations. The session included points
      raised with evaluators by both teachers and providers about what worked
      really well for them as well as what went wrong. These lessons were used
      to highlight key considerations for schools that will help them select
      and plan appropriate CPD provision, and to raise awareness of the wide
      range of potential CPD opportunities available. The benefits of formative,
      as well as summative evaluation were highlighted, especially its role in
      facilitating intervention when problems are identified and acknowledgement
      of effort and progress. An example evaluation framework was constructed
      to show how key sources of evidence can be identified and how it can be
      used to monitor the effectiveness of a CPD programme. A member of the audience
      contributed to testing out aspects of the framework against a recent CPD
      experience. The merits of a range of evaluation techniques were also discussed,
      with valuable input from the audience on newer technology -based techniques,
    such as photographs and video.</p>
    <p>Jane Finch is a MirandaNet Fellow and a leader
    in the Visual Learning group. Her talk looked at:</p>
    <p>      <strong>Primary ICT CPD&#8230; There&#8217;s more to it than just &#8216;getting
      someone in&#8217;</strong><br>
    Jane Finch, Teacher Adviser ICT, HoS Manager, Worcestershire LA</p>
    <p>This session
      considered some of the features of successful Primary ICT CPD, capitalising
      on lessons learned in the Worcestershire Hands on Support
    Scheme.</p>
    <p>Mark Bennison is Deputy Head at Westminster Academy. His talk looked
    at the ways in which ICT can underpin hole-school change.</p>
    <p><strong>Developing a Global
      Citizenship and Enterprise Agenda through ICT Underpinned CPD</strong><br>
      Embracing the RSA 21st century competency-based curriculum, learning is
      integrated and thematic; moving from the yearly theme of community, through
      global citizenship
  to enterprise in the first 3 years (KS3). Tutoring is vertical, e-learning
  embedded, through their Connetix Learning Environment; at its heart, an individual
  learning plan for all students.</p>
    <p>In a secondary school whose catchment is probably
      the most diverse in the UK; 75% of students are EAL, 35 main languages
      are spoken: Westminster Academy
  cannot help but embrace the agenda of global citizenship and has as a core
  vision, the importance of preparing its young people for a perspective which
  is global; economically, socially and technologically. In this session, Mark
  Introduced &#8220;school for a global future&#8221; showing how, working closely
  with organisations &#8211; MirandaNet and iNET &#8211; the global citizenship
  agenda comes to life.</p>
    <p><strong>Practice Based Research - The Becta View</strong><br>
      Dr Vanessa Pittard is Director Evidence and Evaluation, Becta. Her talk
        looked at a theme that is at the core of the MirandaNet community- Practice
        Based
  Research.</p>
    <p>Practice-based research has an important role to play in building
        up evidence of how technology can be used effectively to support learning.    </p>
    <p>It also plays an important role in enabling learning to take place from
        the leading edge and enabling effective professional reflection on emerging
    practice. </p>
    <p>In researching new practice with technology practitioners need
      to consider: robustness of design, capturing the learner experience, assessment
      of outcomes,
  salience and transferability of findings. </p>
    <p>There are particular challenges in
      assessing the value of learning technologies to learning outcomes. A framework
      of outcomes relating to technology for learning
  is presented.</p>
    <p><strong>Dai Thomas, Director of ICT at Warden Park Specialist School and
    Mirandanet Fellow</strong></p>
    <p>Dai&#8217;s talked looked at the reality of CPD for many
      teachers &#8211; and
  then examined what constitutes effective CPD.</p>
    <p>This theme explored a number of
      approaches to ICT CPD and evaluated their effectiveness in terms of school
      improvement, pedagogical change and learning for both pupils
  and teachers. Examples were drawn from a number of projects that have examined
  the affordances provided by new technologies, and ways in which these have
  been used to promote personal and institutional transformation in learning.    </p>
    <p>Discussion following the presentation focused on the issues that still
      arise where teachers fail to take a professional role in their own CPD
      process. This
  is still problematic: possible solutions were discussed. The underlying problem
  seemed to be that many teachers felt that INSET was seen as CPD, and was something
  that was &#8216;done&#8217; to them</p>
    <p> Traditional delivery models of ICT CPD were challenged, particularly
      one-day courses involving large groups, where the theme was inevitably
      general, and
    specific application in the school context was difficult to achieve.</p>
    <p> Teacher research seen as an essential tool for effective CPD focus. The
      MirandaNet model, and the Best Practice Research Scheme, were considered
      as exemplars.</p>
    <p> <strong>Lead Presentation: The Future; Multimodal Literacy &#8211; Examples
      of what this means for Teachers and Children in the Near Future</strong></p>
    <p> Niel McLean, Executive Director, Becta</p>
    <p> Niel&#8217;s presentation looked at the needed for multi-modal models
      of learning to become part of the repertoire of teaching and learning strategies.
      Many
      of the themes were familiar to MirandaNet members, and supported much of
      the work that the community has done in the past few years.</p>
    <p> <strong>ICT CPD in Northern Ireland</strong><br>
      Byron Evans, Adviser, RTU</p>
    <p> This presentation reported on a pilot programme involving forty-eight
      schools in Northern Ireland. The programme had as its main aim the exploration
      of an online collaborative community approach to develop the ICT competence
      of staff
      and to embedding ICT into the life and work of the school, in the context
      of school development planning and whole school improvement.</p>
    <p> <strong>Effective Models for ICT CPD</strong><br>
      Tim Tarrant&#8217;s presentation was a collaborative effort involving Tim Tarrant,
      Head of ICT Team, TDA; Georgina Stein, Canterbury Christ Church University
      and Member of the Naace Executive Committee; Sarah Neild, Teacher, ICT Coordinator
      and AST at Birchley St Mary&#8217;s Catholic Primary School; Zoe Goodwin, Vice
      Principle, Greensward College and Margaret Baxter, Teacher, ICT Team Member
      and AST at Eccleston Lane Ends Primary School</p>
    <p> This session drew on the experience of the TDA and covered its draft
      CPD strategy for the school workforce. It drew on the TDA&#8217;s experience over the last
      8 years and the conclusions that could be drawn. One conclusion was the simple
      fact that the best CPD is most often teachers working with teachers and this
      was illustrated by the work and experience of Sarah Neild and Margaret Baxter.
      A challenge was how we can make initial teacher training, induction and professional
      development a continuum and help reduce the loss of teachers in the first 5
      years of their teaching. The session examined the factors that influence professional
      development in the future and how we might address them.</p>
    <p> <strong>An Inspirational Journey</strong><br>
      Michael Smith is the Professional Development Coordinator, Forest School,
      Snaresbrook</p>
    <p> Michael described his own CPD journey in ICT to bring out strategic issues
      and offer an opportunity for future thinking. This session also investigated
      the importance of collaborative learning environments and multi modal mapping
      for professional development and learning.</p>
    <p> Michael described his own personal journey, which brought him to realise
      the importance of visual learning as a way to recover the complexity of
      ideas and
      engage learners. Through his work as a teacher/researcher with Mirandanet,
      he has investigated the power of multi-modal learning and considered the
      implications for the future in our schools. Do we still need textbooks
      providing information
      in a linear fashion? What are the implications for classrooms as the role
      of teacher and learner becomes blurred,as are the boundaries between schools
      and
      the external community.</p>
    <p> The audience discussed the implications for software development especially
      mapping software and the need for learners to have a more sophisticated
      understanding of how multimedia presentations can be used to influence
      views.</p>
    <p> <strong>Practically Transforming Learning &#8211; The view of the Naace
        Community</strong><br>
      Roger Broadie of Broadie Associates Ltd is Member of the Naace Advisers
      and Consultants Working Group and Coordinator of the Transformed Education
      and
      Pull CPD projects, and as such a long-time friend of MirandaNet.</p>
    <p> Assessment of &#8216;Quality of use&#8217; of ICT in schools is currently geared
      to doing the best we can with what we have &#8211; in the way the school currently
      operates. This is optimisation.</p>
    <p> Schools that have already optimised use of ICT, through use of the Self
      Review Framework and by gaining the ICT Mark, and who wish to aspire to
      transformation
      will require a systemic rethink of the way that learning is organized so
      that schools can achieve significantly greater impact upon pupil achievement &#8211; for
      all. Some schools are now doing this, stretching the gap between schools in
      educational offering and achievement.</p>
    <p> The Transformed Education project has created practical tools for schools
        to assess and develop the best approach to fit their culture and community.
        The
        Pull CPD project is now developing knowledge bases that will aid all
      schools, whether they are still at the stage of optimisation or are amongst
      the
        20% of schools that are developing new pedagogical and school organisation
        approaches.</p>
