  <h2>Building a continuing professional development (CPD) plan over three years 
    for a school cluster or a school</h2>
  <h3>Information and Communications Technology (ICT)</h3>
  <p><a href="#1">How does ICT fit?</a> | <a href="#2">ICT CPD</a> | <a href="#3">Funding</a> 
    | <a href="#4">Quality Assurance</a> | <a href="#refs">References</a></p>
  <p>Intelligent schools are realizing that learning technology can advance their 
    teaching and learning goals. However the technology for learning is changing 
    all the time and schools need a continuous programme of staff development. 
  </p>
  <p>These are some of the fundamental questions a senior management team will 
    want to ask in creating imaginative continuing professional development opportunities. 
    The questions are based on the trends emerging from research about effective 
    ICT programmes for teachers. Some resources are offered to schools for research 
    and discussion (in a side panel to be designed). However this is a complex 
    area of school leadership. Schools will often need to devise unique solutions 
    that reflect local conditions.</p>
  <h4>1<a name="1"></a>. How does the use of ICT fit into our established learning 
    culture? </h4>
  <p>Do we expect ICT to impact on our school </p>
  <ul>
    <li>as a catalyst to help students to be more independent learners; 
    <li>as a means of encouraging staff to think differently about teaching and 
      learning;</li>
    <li>as a means of raising standards in traditional curriculum subjects;</li>
    <li>as a resource to promote new field of learning like citizenship, creativity 
      and thinking skills;</li>
    <li>as a means of increasing contact with the home and national and international 
      communities?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Where can we find evidence of achievement by other schools?</p>
  <p>How will other members of staff be engaged in this debate?</p>
  <p>How will the implementation of an ICT CPD programme impact on performance 
    in SATs and traditional exams? </p>
  <p>Could this CPD programme lead to the identification of innovative and inclusive 
    learning models?</p>
  <p>Could this CPD programme lead to different kinds of evaluation of learning? 
  </p>
  <p>Does our school development plan reflect our views? </p>
  <p>Do we need to drop an aspect of staff training to make space for this initiative? 
  </p>
  <h4>2<a name="2"></a>. An ICT CPD programme for staff </h4>
  <p>Which senior manager will lead the project purposefully, involve the staff 
    and agree with them the pace of the project and how best to manage its implementation?</p>
  <p>Is there appropriate time and training for lead teachers and project managers?</p>
  <p>Can adequate time be prioritised for full staff involvement?</p>
  <p>How will we audit staff needs and deal with basic skills training?</p>
  <p>How can we allow for different teachers' learning styles?</p>
  <p>What paths will we offer for teachers who do not wish to engage with the 
    programme?</p>
  <p>How can we help staff to develop an action plan which identifies ICT directions 
    that interest them and direct them to further consolidation of their practice 
    or the development of new skills areas</p>
  <p>How can we encourage staff who elect to run experimental and innovative ICT 
    projects and help them to build in milestones and develop a portfolio of achievement? 
  </p>
  <p>How can we motivate and reward our staff : by access to online laptop computers, 
    support cover, accreditation, technical support, web publication of successful 
    projects? </p>
  <p>How will we ensure that the achievement of the project outcomes is discussed 
    with individuals as a part of the cycle of professional review and development?</p>
  <p>Do teachers of different subjects require different approaches to CPD programmes? 
    How will this be pursued? </p>
  <p>How many different kinds of accreditation should we offer to suit staff diversity?</p>
  <p>Will elearning facilities extend opportunities for staff learning? </p>
  <p>How will we select external agencies to support the ICT programme and who 
    will liaise with them?</p>
  <h4>3<a name="3"></a>. Funding staff development </h4>
  <p>How much do we know about government and local authority funding for teachers' 
    professional development in relation to the National Grid for Learning?</p>
  <p>What European Union funding channels could be used to increase staff links 
    beyond the classroom? </p>
  <p>Would the BECTs teachers awards, DFEE Best Practice Research Bursaries and 
    Teachers' International professional Development awards from the British Council 
    be useful CPD funding route?</p>
  <p>Could our local community and experienced teachers and students provide workshops 
    and mentoring for staff? </p>
  <p>Do we have a funded broadband infrastructure provided by the government and/or 
    the local region?</p>
  <p>Do we have enough hardware, e-content and staff access to make ICT CPD a 
    viable option? </p>
  <p>Do we have enough money to pay for maintenance, repair and consumables if 
    we use the system more? </p>
  <p>Can we invest in experimental projects with devices like wireless tablets 
    or interactive whiteboards? </p>
  <p>Are we clear about our approaches to teaching IT and teaching ICT across 
    the curriculum? </p>
  <h4>4<a name="4"></a>. Quality assurance and evaluation</h4>
  <p>How will we know when we are achieving our ICT programme objectives in terms 
    of the quality of implementation, the quality of achievement of the outcomes 
    and the impact of the training on professional practice ?</p>
  <p>What will the feedback and reporting cycle be and who will be involved? </p>
  <p>Can we celebrate teachers and students learning achievements on our website? 
  </p>
  <p>How will we monitor the impact of continuing professional development across 
    the staff?</p>
  <p>How will we integrate new ways of working and innovative assessment methods 
    into traditional practice?</p>
  <p>Will students be involved in the evaluation and self evaluation process? 
  </p>
  <h4>R<a name="refs"></a>eferences</h4>
  <p>These questions will be backed up by a list of references that will help 
    senior managers to answer some of these questions. </p>
