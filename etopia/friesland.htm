      Multimodal literacy</h3>
    <p><a href="../fellowship/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=643.html">Dughall McCormick</a>, Holmfirth 
      JIN School, UK</p>
    <p>Multimodal literacy is new on the Friesian agenda. As a result, MirandaNet 
      scholars from England and Germany went out to work with teachers of 4-9 
      year olds in Friesland which is a remote and very beautiful part of the 
      Netherlands. Many thanks to Promethean, 2 Simple and Oracle for making this 
      possible.</p>
    <h3> The role ICT can play in improving collaborative learning and speaking 
      and listening skills</h3>
    <p>This presentation focused on the power of ICT to bring pupils together 
      into collaborative learning activities and projects that will ultimately 
      enhance speaking and listening skills as well as a wide range of other learning. 
      There were video clips of children involved in such activities which included 
      Nursery children working together on a Promethean IWB, an 'ACTIVote' session 
      from a Reception class, Peer tutoring between a 10 year old boy and a 6 
      year old girl, and two 9 year olds collaborating on a project using 2Simple's 
      '2Create a Story' software. Examples of stories made with the 2Simple software 
      were also shown to the audience as well as a brief overview of the package 
      to demonstrate the simplicity and potential of the software. The presentation 
      also included some examples of pages designed on the Promethean ACTIVboard 
      with collaboration and interactivity in mind.</p>
    <p>On the second day we visited schools. We were struck not only by differences 
      from our own systems, but also the similarities.</p>
    <p>The overwhelming impression of the Dutch schools was one of calm and purposeful 
      learning environments which were evidently beginning to embrace technology 
      such as interactive whiteboards. In the school in Franeker, what was particularly 
      striking was the child-centred approach in the early years and the excellent 
      organisation of space and resources that ensures children have a healthy 
      balance of creative, imaginative, physical and problem-solving activities. 
      The children were mainly bi-lingual in Friesian and Dutch and many also 
      had an impressive command of English (as did the teachers).</p>
    <p>We also enjoyed a canal and lake journey which impressed upon us how much 
      water is part of the Friesian soul. </p>

    <p>The town of <a href="http://www.leeuwarden.nl/">Leeuwarden</a> and the 
      surrounding areas were very picturesque.</p>
    <p>We all had a different perspective on the way of life in this rural area. 
      This is what we learnt. </p>
    <p>Having grown up and gone to school in deepest East Anglia, the trip to 
      Friesland was very evocative of my own childhood experience of landscape. 
      The vast sky, the waterways, a slower, more relaxed pace of life all left 
      a deep impression on me. Particular highlights were explaining to a class 
      of baffled 10 year olds that (because I live on such a steep hill) I have 
      to go upstairs in my house to get into the garden - a fairly odd concept 
      the average inhabitant of Friesland, I imagine. Another unforgettable experience 
      was the stay at the Hotel Wyswert in Leeuwarden. The Hotel is part of a 
      University that runs a course in Hotel/Hospitality/Catering Management and 
      is effectively run by students enrolled on the course. The students mentor 
      each other, rotate around all the imaginable jobs to be done in a hotel 
      and provide the highest possible level of service and attention to the customers.</p>
    <p> The Frieslanders were welcoming, friendly, hospitable and cheerful all 
      of which made for an unforgettable experience.</p>
