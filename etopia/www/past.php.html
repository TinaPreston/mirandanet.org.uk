    <p><strong>1955-1991: The birth of an e-community</strong><br>
  Christina Preston&#8217;s father was the first data processing manager
      at Citibank in the fifties which is why she learnt to love and loathe computers
    at an early age&#8230;</p>

    <p><strong>MirandaNet Editor adds</strong>: in a similar vein you might like
      to look at an article I wrote on MirandaNet about my father's experiences
      with early computers: <a href="../../publications/computing_history.htm">Vannevar
      Bush, Douglas Hartree, Jack Howlett</a> (and did Watson of IBM really
      say that the world would only need five computers?)</p>
    <p><strong>1994 : Creative Telematics : A keynote paper for the Women in Computing
      conference where I first met Bozena Mannova</strong><br>
      This is a speech that traces the life story of Christina Preston, a late
      entrant to computing, transferred who from an English and Drama discipline.
      The speech describes the pattern of computers in her early life, some of
      the reasoning behind decisions about educational software, some of the
      results of research and some of about computing in the future from a female
    perspective. </p>

    <p> <strong>1999 : Building on-line professional development communities for schools,
      professional associations or LEAs based on the MirandaNet experience</strong><br>
      The
      first of a series of Routledge books where Norbert Pachler and Marilyn
      Leask gave MirandaNetters the opportunity to publish. </p>
    <p> This chapter&#8217;s focus is on the professional development of teachers
      in information and communications technology (ICT) training. Although many
      schools now consider ICT training as important as numeracy and literacy,
      the reality is most teachers use it only occasionally. Although enthusiasm
      towards ICT is high, there is a lack of training focused on individual
      learning needs and interests for teachers in service.</p>
    <p> The UK government commitment to the establishment of the National Grid
        for Learning presents the teaching profession with well considered and
        funded opportunities to adopt advanced technologies in the staff room
      and the class room. In implementing networks, the profession will have
      to make
        choices about the balance between traditional teaching modes and new
      learning potential. An informed professional debate on these issues is
      the only
      way in which the profession will move forward effectively.</p>
    <p> This chapter looks at one successful model of a mature on-line professional
          development community, MirandaNet, developed as a way for teachers
      to communicate their ICT learning and teaching objectives, as well as gain
          greater access
        to ICT training and equipment.</p>

    <p> &#8220;The close links that develop within on-line communities often commence
      with face-to-face dialogue. As the MirandaNet community grew internationally
      after its start in the UK, technology experts in the Czech Republic were
      invited to participate as community members. The &#8216;East&#8217;/&#8217;West&#8217; collaboration
      began when Christina Preston gave a conference presentation at &#8220;Women,
      Work and Computerization: Breaking Old Boundaries &#8212; Building New
      Forms&#8221; in Manchester, England (Preston, 1994). Bozena Mannova, from
      the Czech Technical University in Prague, attended invited Preston to speak
      to the Czech Technical University&#8217;s Electrical Engineering Faculty
      where Bozena was the only woman on the faculty of nearly seventy members.
      During the conversation, Preston asked Mannova in which hotel she was staying
      in order to arrange a meeting to discuss the presentation. Mannova replied
      that she was staying in the Holiday Inn Manchester, but she would prefer
      to meet at Preston&#8217;s hotel lounge&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p> <strong>2001 : Building new social structures: Can industry and education work
          together? Global Changes in the Funding of Education</strong><br>
      Christina Preston </p>
    <p> At the start of 2000, Communication and Information Technologies were
            contributing to the changing balance of economic strength between
      national governments
            and the multinational companies that are not constrained by boundaries.
            The separation between public policy and commercialism is breaking
            down. </p>
    <p> In particular, national educational policies are more influenced
              by global and economic pressures than they have been in the past.
              For example, electronic technologies are expected to make as much difference
      to literacy and communications
              practices as the Gutenberg revolution made four centuries earlier.</p>

    <p>This small-scale study investigated how teachers can be helped to integrate
      ICT effectively into their teaching. We decided to use a sample of teachers
      who had overcome most barriers and were motivated to use ICT in their teaching
      on a regular basis to explore the factors that had led to their uptake
      and sustained use of ICT. In order to obtain such a sample, we sent 135
      questionnaires to teachers and other educators who were members of three
      professional ICT in education associations, namely MirandaNet, National
      Association of Co-ordinators and Teachers of IT (ACITT), and TeacherNet,
      and their colleagues who were regular users of ICT including the Internet.
      These associations provide support for the practices and professional development
      of teachers using ICT.</p>

      <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong> (restricted to MirandaNet members)<br>
      This paper re-examines the evidence from a national initiative to train
      all teachers in England to bring them up to the level of newly qualified
      teachers who are required to know when to use, and when not to use, Information
      and Communications Technology (ICT) in their professional practice. Data
      gathered for the 2004 evaluation of the programme uncovers the complexity
      of such professional development. Multiple sources of evidence are provided
      on the effectiveness of contrasting approaches to ICT-related teacher training.
      This data was analysed including a national survey of 496 trainees, and
      experts&#8217; reports on 16 of the 47 training providers was analysed
      using Guskey&#8217;s (2002) five levels of professional development evaluation:
      participants&#8217; reactions; participants&#8217; learning; organizational
      support and change; participants&#8217; use of new knowledge and skills;
      and, students&#8217; learning outcomes. This first analysis showed Guskey&#8217;s
      levels to be robust for ICT-related teacher training, including a significant
      correlation between the experts&#8217; views and those of teachers who
      had undergone training. The evidence confirms the value of an ecological
      perspective (Davis, 2008, in press). The most effective training supports
      change with ICT in macro and micro ecologies, including the classroom,
      the school, and training provider&#8217;s region. ICT-related teacher training
      using an &#8216;information transfer&#8217; approach is not appropriate,
      despite its success in commercial train. Email Christina Preston if you

        BJET</strong><br>

    training impacts multiple ecologies: evidence from a national initiative.&quot;</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Summary</strong> (restricted to MirandaNet members)<br>
		The design of continuing professional development to enable teachers
        to use ICT in teaching and learning is little researched, despite increasing
        demand for it in the twenty-first century. A national initiative for
        ICT teacher training in England provided the opportunity to contrast
        two training designs, only one of which was highly rated by teachers
        and educational ICT experts. The highly rated design adopted an &#8216;organic&#8217; approach
        that provided training in schools, whereas the contrasted design efficiently
        deployed computer-based training materials facilitated by on-line access
        to trainers. Although both designs used on-line communities of practice,
        the better rated design deployed it for ICT trainers in training, rather
        than for teachers in training. The contrast of the two designs provides
        support for an ecological view of the diffusion of IT innovations in
        education (Davis, 2008, in press). The decentralized organic model of
        ICT teacher training supported the evolution of ecosystems of the classroom
        and the school, as well as the development of training for ICT teacher
        trainers. In contrast, the centralized model caused more disruption in
        these educational ecosystems. Recommendations include adoption of an
        ecological perspective when designing ICT teacher training.
