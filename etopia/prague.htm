       Workshop: Report by Dew Buddie</h3>
    <h4> Towards personalised learning: implementing the philosophy</h4>
    <p> <em>A CPD event examining the role of ICT in building partnership projects</em></p>
    <p>There is no doubt about the fact that one learns more in the company of
      friends than one does in isolation. So it was that a four-day conference
      to celebrate the 10th anniversary of MirandaNet proved to foster such creativity
      amongst like-minded individuals, that no casual observer could have failed
    to have been impressed.</p>
    <p>It would not have been possible to have picked a more beautiful location
      for the conference than the city of Prague &#8211; a city exuding history
      from every pore, yet with such buildings as &#8216;Fred and Ginger&#8217; showing
      it had creativity itching to be expressed. Somehow that seemed apt for
      what we as delegates set out to do during the course of the conference &#8211; to
      try to be creative in the ways in which ICT could be used with more traditional
      educational tools to enhance learning and make the world a better place.</p>
    <p>The slightly dark location of the conference &#8211; the Technical University &#8211; belied
      the warmth of the welcome we received from our hosts. This set the scene
      for what was to be an extremely friendly conference. A series of ice-breaking
      games allowed us to express how we felt the world could be made better
      and the roles we felt could play in helping that come to pass. It was clear
      that many of us viewed the Digital Divide as an important issue that needed
      to be addressed if we were to provide truly equitable learning experiences
      for all young people on the planet. Perhaps Seymour Papert/MIT&#8217;s
      $100 laptop may go someway towards this &#8211; it was felt this was a
      tool that educationalists would need to harness in future. Many delegates
      wanted a world of peace and harmony which allowed children to live fulfilling
      lives, in addition to a world that, given the current global warming debate,
      was actually in existence in 50 years time.</p>
    <p>To this end, Andr&eacute;e Jordan&#8217;s <a href="https://wec.mirandanet.org.uk/peace_room/">Peace
        Room</a> project is an outstanding
      resource which makes all participants take stock of their lives and pay
      careful consideration to members of society who have made major contributions
      to the world around them. Based on a discovery she made in a visit to South
      Africa, Andr&eacute;e has specified a resource (realised by Francis Howlett)
      which provides a real challenge to young people. What is more, the challenge
      is the same
      for
      all students
      regardless of their country of origin. This task can be undertaken by pupils
      from all over the world and it is possible for pupils from all over the
      world to play a part in the nomination of new individuals to the Peace
      Room.</p>
    <p>It was stimulating to see the work being done in other schools which showed
      how all delegates are using ICT in various, exciting ways to support Learning
      and Teaching within their establishments. The splendour of Prague seemed
      to stimulate ideas amongst delegates with many splinter groups forming
      to feverishly discuss new concepts as they were conceived. A visit to a
      fantastic classical concert one evening served to get the creative juices
      flowing with a flourish.</p>
    <p>The ethos of Etopia permeated the whole conference as delegates strove
      to develop new ways that ICT could be used to aid the learning experiences
      of young people across the world. Dr John Cuthell led the conference with
      a firm hand ensuring that the aims and objectives were always at the forefront
      of our minds. Christina Preston lent proceedings her inimitable stamp!</p>
    <p>As representative of Think.com (courtesy of a generous stipend from Oracle)
        I was able to show delegates ways in which various forms of ICT-based
        community or VLE could be used to foster and encourage collaborative
        work across borders. It was extremely rewarding to receive generous feedback
        from fellow delegates following my presentation. The ThinkQuest competition
        also offers able students the chance to work with students elsewhere
        in the world on collaborative projects which challenge and inspire.</p>
    <p>A visit to a Prague school put the Etopian concept into context, by showing
      the delegates a scenario in which they would put into practice all of the
      plans and ideas that they had. It was clear that these schools teem with
      teachers and students who have a thirst to collaborate, to share and to
      learn.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, what I took away from the conference was an agreement to lead
      a UK-based project for all Etopian member schools. This project will develop
      over the coming months into something that all UK member schools (covering
      the widest possible range of ages, abilities and circumstances) will be
      able to hold up as a beacon to other schools to show how we can let students
      work together.</p>
    <p>As a spin-off I submitted an application to the NESTA Futurelab Call for
      Ideas on behalf of Mirandanet/Etopia, a project called FilmAgora. We believe
      that as children adapt to the collaborative culture of &#8216;Working the
      Wiki Way&#8217;, there is huge demand for them to be able to collaboratively
      edit more than just text. Therefore we propose to create a Wiki tool that
      allows people of all ages and abilities to be able to take a piece of video
      and edit it collaboratively using the principles normally associated with
      editing text in a Wiki. The version history can then be used to revert
      to a previous version if unwanted edits are made. </p>
    <p>There are a plethora of video editing packages which are available to
      run on computers &#8211; there are a range of YouTube video &#8216;repository&#8217; sites
      on the Internet and there are many forms of text-based wiki tools. Our
      proposal suggests a combination of all of the best elements of these resources
      to create a standalone facility to allow collaborative video editing online
      for users regardless of nationality, ability, accessibility or age. In
      other words it is all inclusive.</p>
    <p>It may seem ambitious but this tool is aimed at users of all ages. We
      want to create a customisable skin or interface that will suit the needs
      of the individual whether in terms of simplicity for young children, language
      for non-English speakers, accessibility for people with disability or functionality
      for more skilled users.</p>
    <p>It is important that this tool be made available freely to the global
      community so it must be made Open Source so that others may feel free to
      run with the idea and add bolt on elements to add further functionality
      at a later stage.</p>
    <p>The desire to exploit underused mobile devices drives our ambition that
      the resource must be platform independent so that it can work as well on
      a mobile phone as it does on a PSP or a high spec PC.</p>
    <p>The project will support social constructivist theory as the users will
      be able to discover what each other co-collaborator has contributed to
      the project. We see a community being created where people can collaborate
      on video making tasks irrespective of whatever normal restrictions may
      stand in their way &#8211; such as age or accessibility.</p>
    <p>At a designated point the film clip can be &#8216;closed&#8217; and then
      seen as a finished film.</p>
    <p>It is the wiki nature of this tool and the fact it is housed on the web
      that sets it apart form other tools that are currently available.</p>
    <p>Users can upload new clips of their own for individuals to start editing,
      or they can work on pre-existing clips made by others.</p>
    <p>The system will keep an &#8216;attribution log&#8217; to show the names
      of everyone who has contributed to the finished film and this will be shown
      in the &#8216;credits&#8217; section.</p>
    <p>This is a resource that can be used anywhere that Internet access is available &#8211; at
      home, at school or on the move.</p>
    <p>It may be used for leisure where a user puts on a video clip that they
      would like others to edit with them. It may also be the case that teacher
      can set a project whereby a class uploads and multi-edits a video that
      becomes a class project.</p>
    <p>So we look forward with interest as to whether the application is short-listed
      for the next stage in the process.</p>
