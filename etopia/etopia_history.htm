    brave new world: the birth of an e-community - 1955-1991</h3>
  <p><em>Christina Preston gives some background to the ideas behind the Etopia 
    initiative (<a href="http://www.mirandanet.org.uk/cgi-bin/journals/search_ej.pl?runtype=casedisplay;cid=201;jtype=all;origin=mnet">full 
    article and links for comments in the Etopia E-Journal</a>)</em></p>
  <p>I&#8217;ve been looking back on the critical incidents in my life that led 
    to the founding of the MirandaNet Fellowship in a paper in the MirandaNet 
    Braided Learning Etopia E-Journal volume called, O brave new world: the birth 
    of an e-community - 1955-1991.</p>
  <p>The full paper is also a reflection on the ways in which teachers in my generation 
    were introduced to the use of computers in the classroom in the 1970s, 198os 
    and the 1990s. I shall publish some more of these critical incidents in the 
    ITTE journal in the next few issues. </p>
  <p>ITTE members are invited to add their own critical incidents to the e-journal 
    volume by using the peer review facility. Let Libby know if you also want 
    to publish your incident in the ITTE journal. This way we can build up an 
    auto-ethnographical study of our community&#8217;s history. It will be interesting 
    to reflect on these experiences as we set up the proposed working party to 
    predict the future.</p>
  <p>Here is one of the incidents: </p>
  <p><strong>&#8216;It&#8217;s&#8217; on the timetable</strong></p>
  <p>It was something of a surprise in September 1986 to find <strong>'IT'</strong> in four slots 
    on my timetable. </p>
  <p>&#8220;What is IT?&#8221; I asked the curriculum deputy. </p>
  <p>&#8220;Information technology&#8221; he said patiently. &#8220;You are teaching 
      IT to two first year classes this year starting next Tuesday.&quot;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why me?&#8221; </p>
  <p>&#8220;Because English and Drama teachers communicate well, and because you 
        had a two day MicroElectronics Programme (MEP) government project course on 
        computers in May.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Two days!&#8221; I squealed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well it's two days more than anyone else teaching information technology
    this term.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Remember at this point in time I had still never touched
       a keyboard. In retrospect, I&#8217;m surprised I did not make more fuss,
      but I was too ignorant to know  what I was agreeing to.</p>
  <p>Actually the first
         term was easy as the computers had not arrived. We taught the bemused
         classes from earnest, newly-minted Croydon
         information technology
              
    books. We looked at traditional and modern methods of storing information
               and tried to see how much information was important to our lives.
              We
              interpreted
          road signs, maps and timetables and learnt about using the computer
    for information retrieval, creating quizzes and learning to word process.
              It all seemed
              very 
              relevant and I just wished I had more training than the experience
        of life in this field.</p>
  <p>When the &pound;75,000 grant from the Manpower Services Commission
       finally  was secured for a computer suite it was a difficult pill to swallow.
       I didn't 
      resent the money spent on computers - I thought it essential. But the roof
        of my classroom leaked and I had no lights or curtains in the drama studio.
       
    So I did hope if the cake was small, the arts would not starve altogether.</p>
  <p>When
      the Research machines network of 186 computers was installed, I was promised
      training. We would be kept a week ahead of the students, we were
        assured. 
        But, oh dear, the week we were to start turned out to be the first week
        of industrial action on the matter of directed time. No training for
    me after
        
    all.</p>
  <p>Never mind. The director of computing studies had stuffed a word processing
       manual in my overloaded pigeonhole with a note pinned to it which said, &#8220;Teach
        this for the first six weeks.&#8221; He had also left instructions for
        turning  the network on. Luckily one of the boys in my class seemed competent
        in operating 
      the system. I let him get on with it. For me, every plunge into the computer
         room felt like driving a different car out of the staff car park each
        night. 
      I had no opportunity to use a computer between the sessions with the pupils
         and they were not at all keen to let me have a whole keyboard to myself.      </p>
  <p>The night before the first class, I sat up late copying commands from
         the manual onto flashcards. The package was Word: tiny white letters
         on a black
      screen - remember- and a menu at the bottom that had impenetrable American
      commands like 'transfer'. We diligently typed, saved and printed. </p>
  <p>&#8220;I'm bored, Miss,&#8221; said one of my charges after about two weeks 
      of word processing procedures.</p>
  <p>&#8220;So am I&#8221; I confessed. &#8220;At least you have a computer.
    What  do you suggest?&#8221;</p>
  <p>They huddled together in conference.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why don't we use these computers to do some proper English?&#8221; 
      one ventured.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, let&#8217;s get back to writing about Chernobyl,&#8221; said another. 
    &#8220;That matters.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We could use these machines to publish a sort of newspaper about the 
          tragedy.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Or a magazine... We could write letters about nuclear accident.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, they won&#8217;t know the letters are from children if we use 
            these computers. They might listen to us.&#8221; </p>
  <p>In that computing laboratory my teaching style changed for ever. I was used
     to commanding a class from the front like a keynote speaker - I could tell
    
    a good tale to keep them in their seats. But because the cables had been
     laid round the edge of the room, the children had their backs to me and
    they 
    were totally absorbed, on task, committed - they did not need me. It was
    a  tough moment of truth. But faced by the pupils&#8217; backs in that south
     London computer lab, I reoriented myself and became facilitator and a learner.</p>
