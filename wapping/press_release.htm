  <h2>Christina Preston<br>
    The MirandaNet Fellowship</h2>
  <p><strong>Press release<br>
    November 2001</strong></p>
  <p>At Hermitage Primary School in Wapping in the Docklands of London, parents 
    are welcomed to the MotherShip, a computer suite set up to serve the whole 
    family. As well as attending classes to improve their English and computer 
    skills, parents from many cultures are able to watch films from their own 
    countries. Because Hermitage has beacon status for high academic standards, 
    more high tech facilities are being built where families can enjoy the experience 
    of learning together. </p>
  <p> Hermitage is typical of the schools in the Docklands, an area where highly 
    paid white collar workers from all over the world are neighbours to some of 
    the poorest families in the country. In spite of the difficulties, educational 
    standards are fast improving in the Borough of Tower Hamlets. Teachers use 
    creative strategies to inspire pupils with the belief that they can achieve 
    well despite poverty, overcrowding and cultural tensions. </p>
  <p> In the latest learning strategy, Wapping's 14 headteachers have joined together 
    in the Web Wise Wapping (WWW) project to build a tolerant and productive local 
    community. "It's the sense of community that helps to put your own problems 
    in perspective," commented Mara Chrystie, Hermitage's headteacher. "It seems 
    foolish to attempt to work on ICT developments in isolation when, with a little 
    communication, ideas can be shared, discussed and refined." </p>
  <p> The St Katharine &amp; Shadwell Trust, a local charity, has offered the 
    schools £150,000 to increase the area's Information and Communications Technology 
    (ICT) skills over three years. This is just one of several St Katharine &amp; 
    Shadwell Trust initiatives. By pooling this money, the heads are able to plan 
    a long term ICT professional development programme for the whole staff. </p>
  <p> The 14 heads are using this project to enrich work in the core skills of 
    Literacy, Numeracy and Information and Communications Technology (ICT). However, 
    they realise that WWW also provides an exciting experimental environment where 
    they can test ideas to introduce creativity, thinking skills and citizenship. 
    Each year teachers will start ICT projects in the classroom, supported by 
    tutors and by each other. Parents are involved in learning partnerships too. 
    For example, one group of mothers who attend ICT classes in school will publish 
    books they have written for shared family reading on the Web Wise Wapping 
    website. </p>
  <p> Both headteachers and classroom teachers have willingly put in the extra 
    time for ICT workshops and project development. In recognition of the extra 
    work, at school and home, each project leader is given an Internet-ready Toshiba 
    mobile computer so that they can master basic skills as they go along. </p>
  <p> However, the 28 project leaders in the first year are aiming to do more 
    than just increase computer skills. This innovative programme aims to </p>
  <ul>
    <li>use ICT as a catalyst for pupils' learning progress across the curriculum</li>
    <li>motivate the whole staff to join in ICT projects</li>
    <li>achieve learning outcomes that relate to each school's development plans</li>
    <li>develop secure websites as a participative classroom resource</li>
    <li>build sustainable plans for ICT professional development</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Expertise in ICT professional development and the management of change is 
    provided by MirandaNet, a fellowship of experienced teachers and teacher trainers 
    who encourage their peers to use ICT effectively in the classroom. With MirandaNet 
    Fellows' help, the teachers are exploring new methods of web-based self evaluation 
    so that they can measure their own progress, ask for appropriate feedback 
    and identify their learning needs. Teachers will work in partnership with 
    tutors from London University's Institute of Education, where MirandaNet is 
    based. Those who succeed by publishing their pupils' projects online will 
    be called Web-Wise Wapping Fellows.</p>
  <p> The St. Katharine &amp; Shadwell Trust are working in partnership with Tower 
    Hamlets LEA to resource the Web-Wise Wapping project which will exploit the 
    government's National Grid for Learning opportunities. The participation of 
    industry is another key feature. Toshiba, Promethean and NFER-Nelson are plannning 
    an investigation and evaluation of the learning of both disaffected and gifted 
    children. These special children will be using internet-ready notebook computers 
    and interactive whiteboards with additional tools to encourage pupils' participation 
    in lessons. Other classroom resources will be supplied by Worth Media, Actis 
    and Mimio. The Tools for Schools charity will be providing recycled computers 
    for school and home use. Cisco will establish IT academies in selected schools 
    to raise the level of pupils' ICT professional qualifications and help parents 
    improve their job prospects. The whole project will go live on Think.com, 
    a secure learning website provide by Oracle. </p>
  <p> At their first hands-on workshop at Tower Hamlets' City Learning Centre, 
    Web-Wise Wapping teachers talked confidentially about their educational expectations 
    and their keenness to experiment. Miranda Ross, a teacher at Shapla School, 
    explained how changes in communications style - the new balance between words 
    and pictures - is more easily illustrated in classrooms using the Internet. 
    Children are able to create interactive assignments, integrated video, sounds, 
    pictures, data files and text. The Web-Wise Wapping teachers were excited 
    by the learning potential of the Internet offered in Think.com, which incorporates 
    features like publishing articles, e-mentoring, debates, interviews, hot seats 
    and brainstorming. Miranda observed that as young online multimedia authors 
    and publishers, pupils will develop communication skills and confidence. Their 
    success in these projects will help to raise their self esteem and improve 
    overall standards of literacy. </p>
  <p> The WWW project leaders have divided into three working groups supported 
    by MirandaNet Fellows. One group is concentrating on a range of classroom 
    projects that offer a new perspective on the National Curriculum. Emma Watts, 
    a primary teacher from Blue Gate Fields Junior School was intent on proving 
    that history is not 'bunk' by adding Internet investigation to history lessons. 
    "Wapping: past, present and future" is a National Curriculum project which 
    gets pupils to explore the local area and publish their findings on the Internet. 
    Tim Hibdige, an ICT co-ordinator, commented that: "With these new web resources 
    the investigation of knowledge can match students' quickness of mind and need 
    for variety."</p>
  <p> A second group of senior managers and ICT co-ordinators is concentrating 
    on web design and maintenance of the WWW project web site and encouraging 
    participation in web brainstorming, debates, discussions and reporting. The 
    schools who already have lively public websites will be helping other staff 
    to design and maintain project websites, develop web resources, show children 
    how to explore the internet and publish their work online for new audiences. 
  </p>
  <p> In the third group, head teachers and senior managers are working together 
    to integrate the possibilities offered by new technologies into the curriculum, 
    to transform traditional practices, to use funding efficiently and to raise 
    extra funding. This management group are employing strategies to help their 
    staff embrace the opportunities, rather than feeling under threat. Mara Chrystie's 
    vision for the project was to promote "joy, fun and vitality in learning and 
    a balance in student's community lives as well as in school." </p>
  <p> To ensure that this project is educationally effective web-based lessons 
    range across the key skills of literacy, numeracy and ICT. WWW project leaders 
    are finding exciting ways to use Internet technology to raise pupil's esteem, 
    achieve high levels of motivation and increase leaning gains. The project 
    leaders are also enthusiastic about the opportunities to bring together Wapping 
    pupils who would otherwise never meet and the chance to encourage students 
    from different cultures and religions in the area to work co-operatively. 
    Led by English Martyrs, children from several schools will jointly explore 
    trends in migration with schools in Ireland, Yorkshire and Washington, investigate 
    local history and publish their work on the web. These investigations relate 
    to a new National Curriculum subject with an international flavour, Citizenship. 
    In this context, teachers from St Mary and St Michael's School planned international 
    exchanges with Barbados, South Africa, Ireland and the US. The teachers realised 
    that successful learning will depend on the quality of support given to pupils 
    as they develop confidence in posting ideas and offering opinions to an international 
    audience of school children. </p>
  <p> In discussion about the demands of the Web-Wise Wapping project, the teachers 
    recognised that time would be an issue. The training is something they have 
    voluntarily taken on, though the notebook computers will make working at home 
    more realistic. New skills in assessment and evaluation techniques will also 
    be needed, and the teachers will need to sustain the first momentum and embed 
    the web-based work into the curriculum after the three year project is over. 
    Rachel Jowitt of Blue Gate Fields Infant School believes that the investment 
    of time and energy is worthwhile since a new audience beyond the four walls 
    of the classroom is a powerful spur to pupil's achievement and aspiration. 
  </p>
  <p> At a time of International uncertainty the teachers stressed the importance 
    of international links. Ken Millar from Hermitage said: "In this world and 
    at this time, sharing between communities is of paramount importance." Sister 
    Clare Halpin from English Martyrs School observed, "The project will help 
    children to make sense of the world and give them a sense of balance about 
    living life in Wapping and beyond." </p>
  <h2><strong>The WWW launch</strong></h2>
  <p>Teachers will be talking about their ICT projects at the launch of the project
