      is one of our old traditions which we hope to resurrect (perhaps with the 
      help of a sponsor?).</p>
    <p><strong>Please do not contact us to tell us that a particular link is broken, 
      or to suggest new or alternative links!</strong></p>
  <p>They were awarded to the best educational site of the month and the best 
    community or subsidiary site of the month, using our <a href="criteria.htm">MirandaRose 
    Criteria</a> as our guide. They have not been awarded for over a year now 
    (Jan 2006).</p>
  <p>The July Site-of-the-Month MirandaRose Award goes to:</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.pupiline.net/">Pupiline</a>, a site 
      written and run by teenagers for teenagers. Bright and cheerful, with interesting 
      articles on fashion or film, and with competitions and links to other sites 
      of interest to teenagers, it is, at heart, an anti-bullying site. It includes 
      password protected forums and an area called 'My Pupiline' which includes 
      messages, chat, and diary functions. The Features and Issues sections are 
      deep and challenging, covering bullying, exam stress, driving, getting dumped, 
      epilepsy, debt, bank accounts, sex and contraception, and lots more. The 
      construction of the site is a model of clarity, with very easy navigation.

    it well. There are large interactive clocks which can be used for whole class 
    teaching, and there are games and worksheets to cover all levels of difficulty. 
    A strong feature of the site is the ability to switch between digital and 
    analogue formats. The worksheets allow you to print out an infinite variety 
    of clock faces at all levels of difficulty. One set even has the text in French, 
    making this a very versatile resource. </p>
