    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Nowadays, most people just type a word or two into 
      Google and see what comes up, so we were wondering about keeping this section. 
      However, we do get several visitors, and even the occasional contact thanking 
      us for these items, so they are still here, but mostly <strong>have not 
      been updated for ages</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Please do not contact us to tell us that a particular link is broken, 
      or to suggest new or alternative links!</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Highfurlong School</strong><br>
      This is a site of particular interest to the Special Needs community, though 
      we can all learn from it. MirandaNet Fellow <a href="../fellowship/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=372.html">Eddy 
      Jackson</a> runs this site, and the work they do using assistive technology 
      has been rated as some of the best practice in the country: <a href="http://www.highfurlong.blackpool.sch.uk/">www.highfurlong.blackpool.sch.uk</a> 
    </p>
  <p>This work also features on: <a href="http://www.nwlg.org/pages/resources/highfurlong/">www.nwlg.org/pages/resources/highfurlong/</a> 
    where you can find a list of extremely useful resources.</p>
  <p>The NWLG have also bought the licence for the DARE project &#8211; as featured 
    in the TES In November 2002. </p>
  <p><a href="http://www.burntcakes.com/"><strong>Burntcakes.com</strong></a> 
    is a site dedicated to better history teaching and learning. The Resources 
    area contains an ever-growing selection of teaching and learning resources. 
    Some are freely downloadable, others can be bought. <a href="http://www.burntcakes.com/">wwww.burntcakes.com</a> 
  <p><strong>Revise ICT</strong><br>
    This is a new (and still developing) site for pupils to revise their ICT using 
    a variety of fun methods. Don't be fooled by the simplicity of the games - 
    your editor was soon beaten by the system, let down by his flaky knowledge 
    of Bus Networks. Something for us all. If you ever visited this author's School 
    History site (<a href="http://www.schoolhistory.co.uk/">www.schoolhistory.co.uk</a>) 
    which we recommended some time ago, you will know that this is a quality site 
    built by a dedicated teacher. <a href="http://www.reviseict.co.uk/">Well 
    worth a visit</a>. 
  <p><strong>Suas Educational Development</strong><br>
    This is Ireland's only charity solely dedicated to supporting education in 
    the developing world. Suas provides financial aid and general assistance to 
    community-run schools in order to provide high quality education for children 
    in poverty. <a href="http://www.suas.ie/">Well worth a visit</a>. 
  <p><strong>The Power of Culture: Bangladeshi spirit</strong><br>
    Here's a fascinating site (available in Dutch as well as English) about Bangladeshi 
    culture, produced by students on a course organised by DrikDrik (see our <a href="../international/bangladesh.htm">Bangladesh</a> 
    page for more information and links). 
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://kvc.minbuza.nl/bangladesh/">kvc.minbuza.nl/bangladesh</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>At-Bristol</strong><br>
    This is a commercial site advertising three educational visitor attractions 
    in Bristol. It's full of fascinating areas to explore including web cams, 
    photos, simulators, optical illusions, worksheets and quizzes. Web designers 
    can learn from the layout and navigation of this site as well.

  <p><strong>JCAL: the Journal of Computer Assisted Learning.</strong><br>
    First published in 1985, JCAL is a peer-reviewed international journal which 
    covers the whole range of uses of information and communication technology 
    to support learning and knowledge exchange. Click <a href="../publications/jcal.htm">here</a> 
    for more information, or go to the <a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/users/ktru/jcaljrnl.htm">JCAL 
    website</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Mike Bostock's Implementing ICT Web Site</strong><br>
    MirandaNet Fellow Mike Bostock has produced this updated web version of the 
    NAACE classic publication 'Implementing IT. This is a must for all MirandaNetters. 
    It focuses on four key themes relating to the effectiveness of ICT in schools: 
    leadership and coordination, teaching and learning, managing infrastructure 
    and measuring success. Mike welcomes feedback and comments, and there are 
    links for you to send information and ideas which could be added to this resource.</p>

  </ul>
  <p><strong>Guildhall School of Music and Drama - "Connect" Project</strong><br>
    A project like this that encourages creativity and this amount of participation 
    and interaction between different art forms is something that aligns very 
    much with our goals at MirandaNet.</p>
