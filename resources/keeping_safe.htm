  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>The cross-agency project described in this paper
      builds on the success of an earlier collaboration, called &#8220;Healthy
      Eating&#8221;, by the same
        team of participants (See JAT 3.1 March 2009). Personal safety has become
        an issue of national importance, and here we outline the aims and objectives,
        the project development, and our plans for the future. A film brief was
        provided by NHS Kingston Occupational Therapists (OTs), as there was
      a need within the organisation for training resources, for adults with
      learning
        disabilities, about keeping safe in a range of different settings. The
        film DVD commission provided by NHS Kingston was specific to their own
        personal safety resource needs, but it had sufficient flexibility to
      allow the Lambeth College students to develop many personal skills, and
      to give
        Holy Cross Year 12 Media students and Year 9 Technology students the
      opportunity to be creative.</p>
  <p><strong>Key words:</strong><br>
    cross-agency links, personal safety, AS level media, ICT tools for learning,
    creativity</p>

  <h3>B. Project planning </h3>
  <p>A project planning meeting with all three partners was undertaken in September
    2008. NHS Kingston stated their interest in commissioning the DVD, and outlined
    their need for training resources, for adults with learning disabilities,
    that could be used to provide positive visual images in order to reinforce
    skill development in keeping safe. The inclusion of people with learning
    disabilities in the development of the DVD was an integral component of the
    project. The DVD also needed to cover the areas of the existing keeping safe
    work. A record of the planning decisions made at this meeting can be found
    at the end of this report in the planning details section.</p>
  <p><strong>Script development</strong><br>
    The outline for the DVD was further developed in an additional meeting between
      the occupational therapy service and Lambeth College. During this meeting
      a list of key components for each scene was developed to balance the needs
      of the occupational therapy service with the interests and abilities of
      the Lambeth College students. For example, some scenes were non verbal
    and some voice-overs were incorporated.</p>
  <p>The outline provided by NHS Kingston was specific to their own service needs,
    but it had sufficient flexibility to enable the Lambeth College students
    to be creative, and to use their own knowledge and experiences. This flexibility
    was incorporated to enable maximum participation in the project from students
    with learning disabilities who also had a range of learning and verbal abilities.</p>
  <h3>C. Project development</h3>
  <p><strong>Lambeth College Student Experiences</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Preparation</strong><br>
      The students did their planning throughout the first half of the Autumn
        Term. This initially involved a wider discussion about keeping safe based
        on the
        individual experiences of the students. Once the topic had been introduced
        and students had familiarised themselves with areas of promoting personal
        safety; the project was introduced as an opportunity to further support
        their learning. At this stage, information was given to the students
        that when
        it came to filming they could choose whether to opt in or not. As in
        the previous project accessible video consent forms were used to support
        students
        to make informed choices.</p>
  <p>The students then considered the components of the project, and, through
    topic work, considered the props the script would need, and the potential
    locations, in addition to practising role playing within a range of scenarios.
    The students took it in turns to act out the different scenarios, and to
    try out different roles, in order to see who felt comfortable at acting,
    and who the best actor for the part might be. This was done through the students
    appraising each other&#8217;s performances, until it was agreed who would
    be taking which part. As different students did the acting, different interpretations
    of how to be safe arose. This, in itself, led to useful further discussion
    about ways to keep safe. </p>
  <p><strong>Preliminary filming at Lambeth College</strong><br>
    The filming took place at the College and gave all involved a chance to get
      to know each other, and to demonstrate their acting skills. The Lambeth
      students acted through the different scenarios in the College in a familiar
      setting, so that they felt comfortable. A few weeks later, the students
      were able to watch the film, and this was a chance to review and reinforce
    their work around keeping safe. </p>
  <p><strong>Preliminary filming at Holy Cross</strong><br>
    The students then went to the Holy Cross School to see the community setting
      where the final filming would take place. This visit aimed to familiarise
      Lambeth College students with the locations for the final filming, in addition
      to meeting the Holy Cross students again. Students from Lambeth College
      were also given a tour of the Holy Cross site and shown where the editing
    of the DVD would take place. </p>
  <p><strong>Final filming</strong><br>
    On day one of final filming, Lambeth College students were arrived at Holy
      Cross and asked whether they were feeling confident, and a final check
    was made as to whether they wanted to go ahead with the filming.</p>
  <p>Holy Cross students gave a demonstration of the professional equipment that
    had been hired for the final filming. Lambeth College students gave an overview
    of the scenes that had been rehearsed and &#8220;walked through&#8221; some
    scenes, so that the positioning of the cameras could be finalised. Scenes
    were then filmed and often small differences would occur during the 1-2 min
    clips, which resulted in the need for each clip to be filmed at least three
    times. </p>
  <p>On day two of the final filming the Holy Cross students paid a return visit
    to the College to film the &#8220;shop scene&#8221;. We had two actors to
    buy food from a shop. This took at least five takes, due to other things
    happening in the shop! Also, on this day, the sound recording for the previous
    day&#8217;s filming was added. </p>
  <p><strong>After the filming</strong><br>
    The Year 9 Technology/ICT students at Holy Cross created PowerPoint slides
      of similar scenarios to the &#8220;Keeping Safe&#8221; film. This is detailed
      below. These files were then used at the College to reinforce the learning
    steps around keeping themselves, their property and possessions, safe. </p>
  <p>Although not all the students are in the filmed scenes, the whole group
    took an active part in the perusal of the scripts, and made amendments, or
    provided props and scenery. The making of the film has kept an important
    topic fresh in the students&#8217; minds, with continual reminders.</p>
  <p><strong>Conclusion (Lambeth College)</strong><br>
    Through taking part in the project, Lambeth College students were given the
      opportunity to participate in a multi-agency project in which they were
      key partners. All those doing acting roles stated that they really enjoyed
      taking part in the filming, and working with the group of students from
      Holy Cross. Within the classroom, most of the students were interested
      in the topic of keeping safe most of the time. These lessons involved a
      better level of engagement than other lessons the students participated
      in. This could be due to the students being able to have visual feedback
      of their own performance and other students were able to contribute their
      feedback as well. This led to broad discussions about students&#8217; personal
      experiences and students were given positive feedback from their peers
      when they were making safe choices. It was also noted, and of interest
      to the tutor, that this academic year fewer students lost personal items,
      including college passes, than in the seven previous years of teaching
    experience at the college.</p>
  <h3>Project Development &#8211; The Holy Cross Perspective</h3>
  <p>At Holy Cross, the project began in September, 2008 when the aims and objectives
    were decided. Following a preliminary visit by the Lambeth College students
    to Holy Cross School, and some trial filming, it became apparent that the
    school cameras would be unsuitable to produce the high quality needed to
    create a professional, finished result. In response to this problem, the
    NHS kindly offered the school a budget of &pound;300 to hire a suitable professional
    quality camera, and sound boom.</p>
  <p><img src="images/keeping_safe_2.jpg" alt="Holy Cross Media Studies Students getting to grips with a Sony PD150 camera" title="Holy Cross Media Studies Students getting to grips with a Sony PD150 camera" width="444" height="348"></p>
  <p>In March 2009, Holy Cross AS level Media students took possession of a Sony
    PD150 camera, on hire for several days to allow familiarity with the equipment,
    and a further two days of filming. Lambeth College students, who had practised
    their roles in the filming, arrived at the school on March 4th to work on
    the final shoot. They filmed seven scenes in all. Then, the following day,
    the AS Media students travelled to Lambeth College in order to add the voice-over
    necessary to make sense of the outdoor filmed scenes.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Year 9 Technology/ICT students at Holy Cross were busy adding
    two further dimensions to the project:</p>
  <p><strong>Flash Cards &#8211; a creative dimension to the project using ICT
      tools</strong><br>
    Using a creative mix of images from the &#8220;ToonDoo&#8221; cartoon web
    site, and text files added into a PowerPoint, Year 9 girls made a series
    of &#8220;Keeping Safe&#8221; flash cards to support the project. Following
    a strict Technology design brief, they made a series of coloured cards sets,
    each set showing: </p>
  <p>a. a scene where three things in the picture could be seen to be unsafe </p>
  <p>b. a second &#8220;card&#8221; in which the problem was circled in red (example
    below)</p>
  <p><img src="images/keeping_safe_3.jpg" alt="An illustration of a bedroom with safety hazards circled in red" title="An illustration of a bedroom with safety hazards circled in red" width="528" height="396"></p>
  <p>c. a third card with the safety issue resolved</p>
  <p>These pages were then printed out in colour, and laminated for durability.
    Moreover, because they were in digital format, aspects were then animated
    in a variety of ways, and the files were also saved onto disc. This meant
    that they could now be used on an interactive white board for further training
    purposes, using kinaesthetic learning techniques. This work may provide us
    with a lead into the next project, specifically on kinaesthetic learning.</p>
  <p><strong>Alternative visual dimension added, with animated images</strong></p>
  <p><img src="images/keeping_safe_4.jpg" alt="A cartoon versions of an actual filmed scenario" title="A cartoon versions of an actual filmed scenario" width="600" height="450"></p>
  <p>In
      order to act as a lively introduction to the more serious filmed scenes
    on the final Keeping Safe DVD, and to deploy a second visual learning skill,
        cartoon versions of the actual filmed scenarios were created, in a similar
        way to the Flash Cards, described above. The text used by the Lambeth
    College
        students in their acting was added into the PowerPoint pages as &#8220;thought
        bubbles&#8221; and/or speech bubbles, to show the thinking processes
        needed in keeping safe in different situations.</p>
  <p>    On reflection, however, it was decided that this cartoon element, while lively
      and creative, should be kept separate from the main DVD, rather than being
      incorporated into the filmed version.</p>
  <p>In this way, the project as a whole explored new ways of using visual learning
    techniques:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cartoons, including student animations</li>
    <li>Flash cards</li>
    <li>Digital film (stills, and movie)</li>
  </ul>
<p>The Holy Cross AS Media students then spent time editing the scenes, and
    produced a final DVD to pass on to the NHS, for actual use in their local
    training. All three parties benefited enormously from their involvement in
    the project. Grace comments, <em>&#8220;This was a wonderful project for
    our group to be involved in. Not only were we able to meet three of our AS
    Level
    Media course requirements, but we were also able to work with people from
    Lambeth College, as well as creating a resource that will actually be used
    to support safety issues in our local community.&#8221;</em></p>
  <h3>Occupational Therapy Perspective</h3>
  <p>The occupational therapy service was involved
      in the initial stage of the project planning, in the development of the
    script and in viewing the draft
        DVD. Throughout the project the occupational therapy service had a consultancy
        role, and identified opportunities to experience and participate in new
        occupational roles e.g. as actors, directors, narrators. These included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Positive images of self</li>
    <li>Confidence and self esteem</li>
    <li>Learning through doing</li>
    <li>Work role development</li>
    <li>Health and safety promotion</li>
    <li>Wider picture other local agencies such as
        the police</li>
  </ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>This has, once again, been a highly successful cross-agency collaboration
        in which our experience of working together has been both reinforced
    and enhanced. All three parties have completed what they set out to achieve:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The NHS now has a useful DVD with &#8220;Keeping Safe&#8221; film
    clips which can be used for OT training purposes</li>
    <li>Holy Cross students, in Years
        9 and 12, had the opportunity to be creative within a project which developed
        their ICT and Media skills, as well as enhancing
      their knowledge about the needs of people in the local community</li>
    <li>Lambeth
        College students have gained confidence in their acting skills, as well
        as learning how to keep safe</li>
  </ul>
<p>The next area for us to explore is kinaesthetic learning, and the ways in
