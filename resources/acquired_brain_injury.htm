  <h2>Community Cohesion 4: Acquired Brain Injury Project</h2>

  <p><strong><a href="http://www.holycross.kingston.sch.uk/"><img src="images/holycross_school_logo.jpg" alt="Holy Cross School" width="100" height="98" class="imageRight" title="Holy Cross School"></a></strong></p>
  <h3>Acquired brain injury project</h3>
  <p>Lawrence Williams, Holy Cross
      School, New Malden<br>
      Joanna Tkaczyk, Acquired brain injury co-ordinator, Kingston</p>
  <p>How can schools
        develop practical research projects, designed to address the new government
        Community Cohesion requirements? The project described
        here was undertaken by a south London secondary school in support of
    the work of the Acquired Brain Injury Co-ordinator in Kingston, Surrey. Lawrence
        Williams and Joanna Tkaczyk discuss the project and its outcomes.</p>
  <h3>The background</h3>
  <p>This project came about by word of mouth. The Holy Cross School
      had recently completed a series of practical research projects with the
    local NHS Kingston
        team on Healthy Eating (See: pre December 2009 Issue 42), on Keeping
    Safe, and on Interactive Whiteboard Games. On hearing of these, the Kingston
          Acquired Brain Injury Co-ordinator, Joanna Tkaczyk, contacted the school
          to explore
        the possibility of the school&#8217;s students creating a DVD, to support
    her in-service training needs.</p>
  <p>The ultimate aim of this project, therefore,
        was to produce a DVD featuring the life journey of three brain injury
        survivors as they reached beyond
        the limitations imposed on them. A short video, of about thirty minutes,
        was
        planned in order to give an insight into the difficulties they faced
        on their way to recovery. It is not only a fascinating documentary of
        changes
        occurring
        after a brain injury, but also a compelling account of individual strength
    and determination to take back control over their lives. </p>
  <p>Joanna explains:<em> &#8220;The
        idea of a video production started while I was researching training techniques
        for my workshops on ABI. It occurred
      to me
        that brain injury survivors themselves can give a first-hand account
      of their experience. The insightful personal stories might easily enhance
      our understanding
    of a brain injury. A video seemed to be an ideal carrier.&#8221;</em></p>
  <h3>Project
    development</h3>
  <p>A preliminary meeting was therefore arranged, in the Spring
      Term 2010, to discuss the possibilities of collaboration between Kingston
      Social
          Services and The Holy Cross School. Two Year 11 Media studies students,
          Kate Baxter
          and Katie Reynolds, having completed their GCSE course requirements,
          volunteered to undertake the filming of interviews with two survivors.
          A third survivor&#8217;s
    experience would be included, later, but would not be filmed. </p>
  <p>Concerns
          were raised by the school about how traumatic such a film might be
          for the girls, who were aged only 16, but it was felt that,
          while
          clearly a challenging process, the outcome would be very positive,
          and life- affirming.
          It is a story of adversity, but ultimately it is also one of determination
    and survival. </p>
  <p>Accordingly, meetings were arranged in which Moore Magagula
      and Selasie Tamakloe were invited to Holy Cross to be filmed. The filming
      sessions
            were held after
            school hours in the Media Department of the school. Hand-held cameras
    were used to film the unfolding stories of the participants. </p>
  <p>The
      participants sat before the cameras with their bodies angled obliquely
    towards an interactive whiteboard, on which a prepared
              text in PowerPoint
              had been displayed, in order to provide a prompt for them to read,
              while being filmed. Memory loss is a significant aspect of their
              personal history,
              and so this electronic memory aid was essential to support the
    smooth unfolding of their stories. </p>
  <p>These resulting spoken presentations were
      subsequently edited by the girls to provide a DVD of suitable length for
      the in-service-training
                sessions
                at which they would subsequently be used. The journey of a third
                survivor, &#8220;Scotty&#8221; McCleod
                was also added to the DVD, as text and still images, though he
    was not actually interviewed on film.</p>
  <p>The two designated school
                students, Katie Reynolds and Kate Baxter, displayed a high level
                of professionalism while working on this
                project. Their
                enthusiastic approach to the task, and their media competence,
                were among the significant
                factors influencing the success of the project. Over a period
                of a several weeks - broken by sitting their GCSE examinations
                - they
                produced
                a DVD
    that truly fitted the purpose. </p>
  <h3>The future</h3>
  <p>The video will be now used as a powerful training tool amongst
                  Social Services professionals working with brain injury survivors,
                  and also
                  as an educational
    aid amongst brain injury survivors themselves. </p>
