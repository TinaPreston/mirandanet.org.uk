  </ul>
  <h3>Project Development</h3>
  <p>Occupational Therapists (OTs) in Kingston found themselves in need of support
    materials in healthy eating skills, for people with learning disabilities.
    Accordingly, Lorian Mead, Head Occupational Therapist for the Kingston NHS
    Primary Care Trust, approached Lawrence Williams, at The Holy Cross School,
    to set up a series of meetings through which the aims of the three groups
    listed above might be met.</p>
  <p><img src="images/healthy3.jpg" alt="Lorian Mead (left of picture) and her
    colleague, Jackie Williams, visiting Holy Cross School" width="397" height="298" class="imageRight"
	title="Lorian Mead (left of picture) and her colleague, Jackie Williams, visiting Holy Cross School">The first visits to the school, by Lorian Mead (left of picture) and her
    colleague, Jackie Williams, centred on sharing the work of OTs with the Year
    12 AS Health and Social Care students. These visits supported the work of
    the Holy Cross AS students, as well as widening the knowledge of the OT group
    regarding school Health and Social Care course requirements, as explained
    here by Nicki Murphy (right of picture).</p>
  <p>Jackie Williams, OT, writes, <em>&quot;Overall I felt that both of the sessions
    had gone very well. The students appeared interested and motivated, and I
    could see the level of engagement improve as the session developed, particularly
    when interactive activities were being used. </em></p>
  <p><em>I feel that the information shared on what the role of OT was helped
    by adding in some &#8216;real life&#8217; examples of my practice.</em></p>
  <p><em><img src="images/healthy4.jpg" alt="Planning session using the Interactive Whiteboard" width="397" height="298" class="imageRight"
	title="Planning session using the Interactive Whiteboard">The activities that were used really helped to illustrate to the student
    groups, and the complexities associated with understanding communication.
    Students appeared to begin to understand the importance of being able to
    recognise the importance of identifying the communication needs of individuals
    with learning disabilities, to be able to adapt communication approaches
    in a flexible and effective way, to suit these needs. Through the use of
    a case study activity, the students demonstrated that they had an understanding
    of the roles of some of the professionals that are based within a multi disciplinary
    community team.&quot;</em></p>
  <p>    <strong>The Consultants</strong><br>
    As another part of the learning process for teachers and students at Holy
    Cross, Lloyd Mead, from Lambeth College, brought a group of his students
    to act as Consultants on the project. They spent a valuable morning at Holy
    Cross, working on the project alongside the AS Level group. </p>
  <p>The information and expertise both in learning disabilities, and healthy
    eating, gained from the OTs and from the Lambeth College students was then
    passed down to a group of Year 9 students, who stayed behind on several Mondays
    after school, to work on the project. Their task was to cook a series of
    healthy meals, and to record the whole process with a digital camera, so
    that the food recipes would be in an accessible format for people with learning
    disabilities. These eight recipes, worked out in consultation with Jackie
    Williams, were for Tomato Soup, Spaghetti, Baked Potato, Cheese Salad, Chicken
    Curry, Salmon and Broccoli, Baked Apple, and Fruit Salad.</p>
  <p>Philippa writes, <em>&quot;Our Year 9 group made the food and photographed
      each stage of the process. It worked well, and we soon got into the hang
      of making
    sure nothing else was in the photo shot.</em></p>
  <p><em>We worked well as a team, and I thoroughly enjoyed finding the Tomato Soup
    recipe, and then actually cooking the food. I even tried cooking some of
    the things at home. The step by step way that we made the food meant that
    I memorised the recipe without even realising it, so that if a person asked
    me for a recipe for Spaghetti Bolognese, for example, I would be able to
    give them the recipe out of the top of my head!</em></p>
  <p><em>Overall, the project was wonderful, and a lot of fun to do, not only as
    it going to be used by other people, but because it taught me, and the others
    who did it, how to cook well, and how to make healthy meals that anyone can
    enjoy.</em></p>
  <p><em>Thank you!&quot;</em></p>
  <p>    Following the Year 9 cooking and photography work, the images of the cooking
      process were added into PowerPoint files, each file containing one of the
      recipes listed above. </p>
  <p><img src="images/healthy5.jpg" alt="Making the PowerPoint slides" width="577" height="361" title="Making the PowerPoint slides"></p>
  <p>Then the project moved down, again, this time into Year 8, where two students
    added some of the Widgit text and symbols. This was not simple, as the students
    had to write the text in Widget, take a screen shot of the text and images,
    drop the screen shot into Paint, and edit it before importing it into PowerPoint.</p>
  <p>Next, some of these PowerPoint files were sent electronically to Lambeth
    College, where Lloyd Mead&#8217;s students tested out the accessibility and
    accuracy of the presentations. Adjustments and improvements were then sent
    back to Holy Cross, to be incorporated into the revised recipe versions.</p>
  <p>Next, the completed files were given to two Year 7 Korean students, who,
    with the help of their parents, translated the recipes into Korean. They
    did this by adding Korean text files next to the English language Widgit
    images:</p>
  <p><img src="images/healthy6.jpg" alt="Making the PowerPoint slides" width="421" height="303" title="Making the PowerPoint slides"></p>
  <p>(NB the <strong>Widgit</strong> images on this slide are Copyright &copy; <a href="http://www.widgit.com/">Widgit
    Software</a>)</p>
  <p>Year 7 students also provided an additional feature to the project, by creating
    a series of four safety logos, which were added into the PowerPoint at appropriate
    moments. Two examples:</p>
  <p><img src="images/danger.gif" alt="Take Care - Danger!" title="Take Care - Danger!" width="145" height="131"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/danger_electricity.gif" alt="Take Care - Electrical Danger" title="Take Care - Electrical Danger" width="145" height="139"></p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>ICT tools used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Email was used for regular communication between the participants</li>
    <li>PowerPoint
      was used to create a framework for the recipes </li>
    <li>Digital cameras were used
        to photograph the cookery images</li>
    <li>Widgit software was used to write the
        illustrated text</li>
    <li>Paint was used to edit the Widgit images, and to create
        the Warning Logos</li>
    <li>On-line Korean dictionaries were used to assist translation</li>
    <li>CD Roms were
      burnt to house the shorter version of the project (File size 0.7 GB)</li>
    <li>DVDs
        were burnt to house the full project, including the Korean files and
      Reports (4.7 GB)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Print outs</strong><br>
    To indicate to potential users how the files on the CD Rom and the DVD could
      be used, a plastic bound printed version of one of the recipes was printed
    out.</p>
  <p><strong>Use of the materials</strong><br>
    Almost as soon as they were printed out, copies of the recipes were used
    by Lambeth students, Holy Cross teachers (SEN Department) and school students,
    and student teachers.</p>
  <p><strong>Future plans</strong><br>
    At Holy Cross, we plan to develop the science aspects of the work through
    detailed analysis of the nutritional content of the recipes. This information
    will be added into the second phase of this visual learning project. </p>
