  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
      This paper outlines a developing international project, currently being
        undertaken between The Holy Cross School, a secondary girls&#8217; school (11 &#8211; 18
      years) in south London, and Taichung First National High School (TFNHS),
      in Taiwan. It follows on from the success of a previous international collaboration, &#8220;<a href="../star/star.htm">Science
      Through Arts</a>&#8221; a cross-curricular project, integrating video-conferencing,
      email, and the web to develop an understanding of space science. The aim
      of this new English language project is to explore ways of combining IWB
      technology with cheaper, web-based video-conferencing equipment, in order
      to enhance the language-learning experience of secondary school students
      of English, in Taiwan. This model, when properly developed, can then be used
      to support on-line English Language teaching with many other countries, on
      a business footing. English teaching thus becomes an economic resource. It
      has enormous potential. The first phase of the project uses the <a href="http://conf5.lgfl.org.uk/clicktomeet/">ClickToMeet</a>      video-conferencing web site, and the interactive tools, including IWB, sharing
      documents, and sharing applications, that it supports. The second phase will
      explore the use of Promethean IWB, with the use of two classroom cameras
      (at the front and back of the classroom) which capture the whole experience
      of student interaction. The creative aspects of the project are being driven
      from London, and the project is being supported in its research aspects by
      Professor Hao-Jan Chen, English Department, National Taichung Normal University
      (NTNU), as part of an MA submission by co-writer Teresa (Shu-fen) Chang in
      Computer-Mediated Communication. The results, from the student and teacher
      reviews and questionnaires at the end of each phase of the work, will be
      submitted to NTNU, posted on the <a href="http://web.tcfsh.tc.edu.tw/england/index.html">TFNHS
      STAR web site</a>, and published on MirandaNet
      (<a href="index.htm">Resources</a>), so that other teachers can benefit from the experience of on-line
      English language teaching developed though this project. Teresa Chang&#8217;s
      methodology forms the second part of this paper. Both the project and the
      evaluation are on-going work.</p>
  <p><strong>Key words:</strong><br>
    Video-conferencing, IWB, international links, English teaching, cultural
    exchanges</p>
  <p>The project began in mid-December 2006, when Mr. Jao-fu Wang, an experienced
    physics teacher at Taichung First National High School, had the opportunity
    to take part in a visit to London, which was hosted by the DCSF. At the Holy
    Cross School, south London, he was introduced to the Science Through Arts
    Project (STAR). This project was devised by Lawrence Williams and developed
    over a number of years with the active support of the <a href="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/MarsV/appD.htm">NASA
    Glenn Learning Technologies Project</a>, (LTP) Cleveland, Ohio, USA. STAR
    combines NASA space science data from the web, with creative writing, music,
    dance and drama.
    <a href="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/MarsV/ssteam.htm">Students from
    across the USA, Japan and the UK</a> were involved in the exploration
    of space science data through video-conferences organised by NASA&#8217;s
    educational consultant Ruth Petersen, and with on-line lectures and discussion
    sessions given by Joseph C. Kolecki, NASA Pathfinder scientist. Seeing the
    educational potential in this cross-curricular application of science, Jao-Fu
    created a web site immediately upon his return home to Taiwan. This web site
    was created in English and Mandarin, to support his school&#8217;s involvement
    in the project. It includes, on the introductory page, the names of the original
    NASA science team and within the site there is the space science data specially
    selected by Joseph C. Kolecki (<a href="http://web.tcfsh.tc.edu.tw/england/index.files/link(en)/STAR%20Websites%20from%20Ruth.doc">download
    in Word format</a>) from the myriad
    NASA web sites available. </p>
  <p>On the left hand side of <a href="http://web.tcfsh.tc.edu.tw/england/index.files/Page433.htm">TFNHS
      web site</a>, there are examples of the students&#8217; learning
    outcomes from both countries (Taiwan and England), achieved using a powerful,
    though expensive, classroom-based video-conferencing unit. STAR lessons were
    planned by email, and students shared their learning outcomes during the
    video-conferences.</p>
  <p>The next step was provided by Ms. Teresa Chang, an English teacher at Taichung
    FNHS, who also saw the potential of a video-conferencing link between the
    two schools. Accordingly, Teresa and I set out to explore the teaching of
    English language and literature using a variety of methods, as well as sharing
    cultural information about sport, social, and educational issues. This marked
    a considerable change of direction for the two schools. On each occasion,
    these conferences were filmed in Taiwan, and the resulting files have been
    posted on the same web site. In London, screen shots were taken, and sent
    to Taiwan to add to the project record. After discussion, we decided that
    we would not edit the filmed footage, as the material posted on the web site
    is intended to be a real-time and real-life record of the exploration of
    the educational possibilities of this new way of working. </p>
  <p>For this series of lessons, we used a deck-top video-conferencing camera
    and microphone costing well under &pound;100, as this reflects the more usual
    level of equipment available in schools. Connection problems are minimised
    by using the video-conferencing web site provided by the London Grid for
    Learning (LGfL). When using this external &#8220;ClicktoMeet&#8221; web site,
    security is provided by LGfL, and school to school firewall problems are
    therefore circumvented.</p>
  <p>Through this series of conferences/English lessons, we set out to explore
    the use of all resources available through LGfL. These include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Presenting a document</li>
    <li>Touring the web</li>
    <li>Videoconferencing</li>
    <li>Sharing applications</li>
    <li>IWB</li>
  </ul>
<p>We have also tried to vary the presentation methods: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The teacher in London talking directly to students in TaiwanStudent groups
      in London working with student groups in Taiwan</li>
    <li>Formal &#8220;lecture-style&#8221; sessions</li>
    <li>Informal discussion sessions</li>
    <li>Prepared and unprepared question and answer
        sessions</li>
    <li>A mixture of these strategies within each conference</li>
  </ul>
<p>The conferences, posted in order on the web site, have covered:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>	Exploring the use of the equipment: genuine trial and error time!</li>
    <li>English
      language: some basic difficulties explained</li>
    <li>Food (recipes, including Taiwanese &#8220;coffin
        bread,&#8221; presented,
      illustrated, annotated remotely, and explained using the IWB)</li>
    <li>Sport in Taiwan
      (sharing PowerPoint and Word documents)</li>
    <li>Harry Potter (reading and discussion)</li>
    <li>Social and cultural discussions
        (the work-leisure balance in the two countries)</li>
    <li>Holy Cross students teaching &#8220;Hard
        Times&#8221; by Charles Dickens</li>
  </ol>
<p>We have been assisted greatly, at each conference, by the generously-given
    time and expertise of Mr. Jao-Fu Wang, and we wish to record our gratitude
    to him for sharing our vision of education, and for the practical assistance
    he has unstintingly given. <br>
    Currently, there are 7 filmed conferences posted on Jao-Fu&#8217;s web site,
    each lasting about one hour. As this work is unedited, there is clearly a
    significant amount of raw data for further study.</p>
  <p>As part of the reflective process, Teresa Chang is being supported in the
    research aspects of this project by Professor Hao-Jan Chen, English Department,
    National Taichung Normal University (NTNU), as part of an MA submission in
    Computer-Mediated Communication. The results, from the student and teacher
    reviews and questionnaires at the end of each phase of the work, will be
    submitted to NTNU, posted on the TFNHS web site, and published on MirandaNet
    (under <a href="index.htm">Resources</a>).</p>
  <p>We have also been supported by the new Taichung Principal, <a href="http://web.tcfsh.tc.edu.tw/england/index.files/Taiwan/Principal_Koo%27s_Theme_Article(E).htm">Mr.
    Kuo Po-chia</a>    who writes on the web site:</p>
  <blockquote><p>The successful exchange between both schools should be attributed to the
    frequent correspondence between Mr. Lawrence Williams of Holy Cross School
    and Teresa Chang, English teacher of our school, and the continuous assistance
    from Jao-fu Wang, science teacher of our school. They have carefully planned
    every detail of the exchange procedure and instruction.</p>
  <p>With basic forms of technology and equipment, teachers and students from
    both schools have managed to overcome the limitation of time and space and
    have thus successfully conducted rounds of conversations and learning sessions
    through the media of video-conference. In some cases, our students introduce
    to their counterparts in Holy Cross sports, food, and campus life in Taiwan;
    in other cases, Mr. Lawrence Williams offers lectures on English vocabulary
    and etymology, guides the students to read Charles Dickens&#8217; &#8221;Hard
    Times,&#8221; and explains writing skills in literary works, which makes
    it easier for them to appreciate the beauty of English literature.</p>
  <p><strong>Principal Kuo Po-chia</strong></p></blockquote>
  <p>We are now building a teachers&#8217; resource section on the same web site
    (&#8220;<a href="http://web.tcfsh.tc.edu.tw/england/index.files/Works%20by%20English/teachingmaterial/teachingmaterial.htm">Teaching
    Materials</a>&#8221; on the right hand side of the main page),
    so that teachers can see some of the methods we have used to develop the
    learning of the students. Though we are still in the exploratory mode, we
    both feel, as teachers of English, that the students in Taiwan have clearly
    gained considerably both in their confidence in using English, and in their
    speaking and listening skills. We will continue, in September 2009, to develop
    these lessons still further inn the second phase of this collaboration.</p>
  <p>Teresa Chang&#8217;s methodological paper now follows. In it, she explores
    some of the shortcomings of attempting to sustain student interest by email
    only (e-paling), and explains the method of assessment currently being developed
    for the project as a whole. </p>
  <h3>EFL Senior High School Students&#8217; Perceptions of CMC Activities between
    Taiwan and U.K. </h3>

  <p><strong>Chapter One: Introduction</strong></p>
  <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong><br>
      Computer-mediated-communication (CMC) has changed the course of language
        learning since its emergence. As best described by Chin-Lung Wei (2007)
        in his introductory chapter, there are the following reasons for the
      integration of information technology into TESOL:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>to facilitate communicative
      language teaching</li>
    <li> to catch up with the age of information technology</li>
    <li>to promote acculturation</li>
    <li> to stimulate learning motivation</li>
    <li> to facilitate flexibility</li>
    <li>to increase the students&#8217; exposure
        to the target language</li>
    <li>to facilitate collaborative instruction</li>
    <li>to support lifelong learning</li>
    <li>to enhance global views. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>With the overwhelming effects CMC has on
      language teaching and learning, to incorporate the information technology
    into the classroom is not only an innovative alternative but also an indispensable
    necessity for language
        teachers.</p>
  <p>Communicative language teaching places the focus on the cultivation
      of learners&#8217; communicative
          competence, and has generally been accepted as a norm in the field
      of TESOL. As can be observed in the educational environment in Taiwan,
      the Communicative
          Language Teaching Approach has gained its due recognition and popularity
          among K-12 language instructors during the past decades. With the extensive
          implement and application of the Communicative Language Teaching (CLT)
      approach
          in most pre-school language institutions as well as elementary schools,
      the students can enjoy a relatively more pleasant experience in learning
      English.
          However, the situation changes drastically once they enter junior high
      schools. Partly due to the pressure from the Basic Competence Test, and
      partly due
          to the teachers&#8217; limited English proficiency and the lack of
          ideal teaching and learning contexts, many local English teachers (mostly
          non-native
          speakers of English) find it difficult to apply CLT techniques in their
          own classes, which can probably explain the prevalence of the traditional
          Grammar-Translation
          Approach and/or Audio-lingual Method in most local high schools. These
          English teachers are compelled to put greater emphasis on reading and
          writing skills
          as a compromise. They compress the class hours originally meant for
          communicative activities and replace them with monotonous drill practices
          and endless
          written tests. The test-oriented teaching methods have entirely spoiled
          the students&#8217; appetite
          for learning English.</p>
  <p>The situation goes from bad to worse when the
          students enter senior high schools. Despite the fact that most language
          instructors are aware
          of
          the significance and effectiveness of adopting the CLT approach in
          language courses, the traditional Grammar-Translation Method is not
          only widely
          in use but
          also takes up a considerable proportion of the class hours. To ensure
          that
          the students can do better in the College Entrance Examination, teachers
          are keen to fill the class periods with supplementary reading materials
          and simulation tests. As a consequence, it&#8217;s not uncommon to
          find students with little motivation in learning English, for they
          are fed up with the
          boring lectures and tests. To respond to the students&#8217; demand
          for a greater variety in learning activities in English courses, an
          increasing
          number of English teachers in senior high schools are taking action
          to provide
          the students with as many opportunities as possible for them to engage
          in communication activities. </p>
  <p>On the other hand, the emergence of the
          Internet is changing the way that people learn and teach. With the
          World Wide Web, students can
          have access
          to an amazing variety of resources to facilitate them in learning,
          especially in language learning. Students of the present generation
          are getting
          used to the e-learning environment and acquiring their knowledge via
          the Internet.
          Being a passive listener, sitting at the desks, and listening to the
          Grammar-Translation lectures can by no means meet the students&#8217; expectations
          of English classes in the Internet Age. To motivate the students in
          learning English,
          teachers need to satisfy their desire for more web-based activities
          in the classes first. With this in mind, English teachers need to take
          the
          initiative
          in incorporating CMC activities into the curriculum. </p>
  <p>As far as TESOL
          is concerned, Collaborative Learning (CL) has been regarded as both
          beneficial for developing interactional language skills.
          Being
          a practical teaching strategy for facilitating learner-centred, whole-language
          learning CL proves to be an ideal alternative for ESL/EFL teachers
          who want
          to actualize CLT. (Wei, 2007) What&#8217;s more, when it comes to effective
          measures to ease learners&#8217; anxiety and promote their learning
          motivation, collaborative learning has also been one of the most frequently
          mentioned
          solutions recently. With its close relation to CMC learning activities
          in the language classroom, collaborative learning has actually been
          enlisted &#8220;among
          the most useful ways in which learners acquire language at the computer.&#8221; (Beatty,
          2003). When learners discuss the process and content in the target
          language at a computer, they are involving themselves in scaffolded
          learning, helping
          each other improve their language. As Warschauer (1997) points out,
          the distinctive features of on-line communication provides impressive
          new ways to link learners
          and encourage them to collaborate, for it is text-based and computer-mediated,
          many-to-many, time- and space-independent, usable across long distances,
          and distributed via hypermedia. What&#8217;s more, these features make
          online learning a potentially useful tool for collaborative language
          learning. And
          this is especially true when they are put in the context of socio-cultural
          learning theory, which emphasized the educational value of creating
          cross cultural communities of practice and critical inquiry. Considering
          all the
          above positive effects of collaborative learning, the study also intentionally
          include this significant element into the design of the CMC activities,
          with the hope to better facilitate students&#8217; learning through
          the collaboration program. </p>
  <p>To provide the students in the senior high
          school in discussion with a virtual learning context where they can
          interact with other competent
          language
          users
          and carry on real-situation communication, an e-learning partnership
          was created between Taiwanese and British students in 2007. Web-based
          activities
          such as e-paling, on-line discussions and videoconferencing are conducted
          for the students on both sides to develop their language skills as
          well as to enhance their understanding about the other culture. They
          collaborated
          on reading literary works and sharing and exchanging cultural information
          as well as working together on science projects. Furthermore, a website
          was
          set up for them so as to facilitate them in sharing and exchanging
          related information and the outcome of their language production via
          the Internet.
          After establishing the partnership for a year, the students took great
          interest in participating in such interactive communication activities.
          Most of them
          held positive attitude toward the on-line learning experience and express
          appreciation of the collaboration program. The teachers are also encouraged
          by the students&#8217; strong motivation in learning English and their
          active participation in the activities. So far, the program proves
          to be a very
          promising alternative in English courses in senior high school. </p>
  <p>During
          the year of collaboration, in spite of the students&#8217; and teachers&#8217; positive
          reactions to the on-line partnership, several limitations were identified
          in conducting this project. First, technical problem existed, the videoconferencing
          session in particular. Second, the e-paling correspondence didn&#8217;t
          last long, for the students found that they soon ran out of suitable
          topics to
          talk about in the e-mail. They also felt it awkward to discuss personal
          affairs through the e-mail correspondence. Third, engaging in the exchange
          activities
          proved time-consuming for the students. To prepare for sufficient information
          to exchange, students on both sides need to do preliminary assignments
          before they had another round of videoconferencing. Some of them even
          felt reluctance
          to work on the extra assignments. Finally, corresponding with a distant
          partner for the purpose of conducting learning activities in the language
          courses
          also proved to be time-consuming for the school faculty. Besides, coordination
          among the students, the teachers, the technician staff on both side
          created a heavy burden and extra workload for the teachers. Last but
          not the
          least, the nature of international collaboration also adds to the difficulty
          in
          managing the exchange program. For instance, the time difference between
          Taiwan and U.K. greatly limited the possibility to hold videoconference
          with a higher frequency. Moreover, to overcome the differences in the
          length of
          the semesters in both countries and the school schedules, the connection
          can only be established for three month at most in each semester. These
          limitations are all the main issues that the present study intends
          to deal with. </p>
  <p><strong>Chapter Two: Literature Review</strong></p>
  <p><strong>2.1 Previous Studies</strong><br>
      This section reviews a number of studies that focus on the effectiveness
      of CMC via cross-cultural links to enhance students&#8217; language learning.
      The four types of the specific CMC activities included in the studies serve
      as the organizing framework of this section: (a) e-mailing, (b) on-line
    discussion, (c) videoconferencing and (d) Internet website.</p>
  <p><strong>2.1.1 E-mailing</strong><br>
      Vinagre (2005) points out in her review of literature that &#8220; previous
        research suggest that email can facilitate communication(Cooper &amp; Selfe,
        1990), reduce anxiety (Kern, 1995; Sullivan, 1993), increase oral discussion
        (Pratt &amp; Sullivan, 1994), enhance student motivation (Warchauer,
        1996a; Ushioda, 2000), facilitate social learning (Barker &amp; Kemp,
        1990) and improve writing skills.&#8221; (Warchauer, 1996b). In addition,
        Vinagre (2005) also states that the use of email offers students opportunities
        for authentic
        and cross-cultural communication, helps enhance their development of
        reading, writing, and speaking skills in language learning, and provides
        them with
        the opportunity to re-examine the messages of their own as well their
        partners&#8217;,
        which facilitates reflective learning and fostering awareness. The results
        of Williams&#8217; (2004) study suggest that exchanging emails with native
        speakers of the target language can have great benefits to the students, &#8220;such
        as using the target language for an authentic use, making new friends,
        and learning about their culture.&#8221; Similarly, the subjects of Lin&#8217;s
        (2003) study express a strong preference toward the e-paling activity
        to the other two web-based activities (on-line forum and videoconferencing).
        All of these studies suggest that &#8220;the integrating of email as
        a support to other language teaching and learning activities represents
        without doubt
        significant added value both for the learners and instructors.&#8221; (Absalom &amp; Marden,
      2004) </p>
  <p><strong>2.1.2 On-line discussion</strong><br>
      Compared with the other web-based activities, on-line discussion or text-chat
          seems to be a less demanding task in terms of the load of second language
          communication. In this type of communication, students do not &#8220;need
          to concentrate on listening to the partners&#8217; utterances, but
          can understand others&#8217; utterances by reading the text message.&#8221; (Yamada &amp; Akahori,
          2007) Since the students tend to concentrate more on the text message
          displayed in the screen, rather than the partner&#8217;s physical image
          or voice, they are allow more time and attention to form an opinion
          and construct a sentence
      with greater grammatical and lexical accuracy.</p>
  <p><strong>2.1.3 Videoconferencing</strong><br>
      Ramirez&#8217;s (1998) finds in her study the following positive aspects
      of using videoconferencing in language learning.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Tt is an innovative,
      hands-on approach to practicing conversation.</li>
    <li>It provides students with
        an opportunity to converse and exchange ideas with students from other
        cultures, thus facilitating intercultural
        understanding.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To the subjects in Jones &amp; Sorenson&#8217;s (2001) study,
      the videoconference between students in America and France gives them &#8220;access
      to the way their foreign peers perceive political issues; such interpersonal
      exposure
          is not so readily available by other means.&#8221; And they further
          point out that the videoconference, as compared with e-mail and website
          exchanges, occurs
          in real time and personal views are expressed extemporaneously. For
          them, this kind of authentic exchange would not have been possible
          if it were not for
          the face-to-face opportunity provided by the videoconference. In both
          Pei-shuang Lin (2003) and Chih-cheng Lin&#8217;s (2007) studies, the
          participants have given positive responses to the videoconferencing
          activity. Most students perceive
          their improvements in language learning as well as in cultural understanding.
          With all the provided evidences, videoconferencing proves to be a promising
      alternative in CMC activities.</p>
  <p><strong>2.1.4 Internet website</strong><br>
      According to Wei (, 2007), unlike a traditional book, which may be
            found in the shelf of a library, a website is like a collaborative
            book on
            the internet
            that allows a variety of elements such as texts, graphics, sound,
        video, to be linked together. It can either function as a digital bulletin
            board, a platform
            for displaying course schedules, supplementary materials, and even
            students&#8217; performances
            and productions or serve as a virtual classroom, where students,
            the partners, and the teachers can communicate with each other to
            enhance the efficiency
            and effectiveness of language learning activities. Since a majority
            of CMC activities are conducted through the World Wide Web, a well-designed
            website
      seems a must for the application of web-based courses.</p>
  <p><strong>2.1.5 Comment
            on These Studies</strong><br>
      Since most of the previous studies suggest positive feedback from
            the participants for the CMC activities through a cross-cultural
            link with
            students in a
            foreign country, they give insights into the significance of the
            incorporation of
            these activities into the language curriculum. However, despite the
            effectiveness of the construction of a website on web-based instruction,
            few studies
            have addressed the importance and necessity of constructing a website
            for the
            CMC
            activities in language learning. Even in the limited studies which
            did include a website into the curriculum, little attention is paid
            to its
            interactive
            functions. This has led the researcher to place greater focus on
            enhancing students&#8217; learning improvement through an active
            use of the website. In addition, in these studies, most participants
            are of university levels,
            with only a small number of them having students of senior high school
            level as subjects. Therefore, further studies with participants of
            a senior high
      school level need to be conducted.</p>
  <p><strong>2.2 The Present Study</strong><br>
      As Warschauer (,2000, 2005) points out, since language learning is
              a complex social and cultural phenomenon, short-term quantitative
              studies may fail
              to account for the complex interaction of social, cultural, and
        individual factors
              that shape the language learning experience. It is even more so
        when the process of language learning involves new technologies that
        connect
              the
              classroom to
              the world. In response to the call for more interpretative approaches
              to adopt when conducting research in this field, the present study
              aims
              to
              investigate the students&#8217; response to the CMC activities
              and how these activities change their attitudes toward language
              leaning and help enhance their confidence
              through a mixture of quantitative and qualitative research. The
      research questions of this study are as follows: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>What are the students&#8217; perceptions of the activities?</li>
    <li>Which of the CMC activities may enhance ESL senior high school
              learners&#8217; confidence
              in using in English as a foreign language?</li>
    <li>Which of the CMC
                activities may promote multicultural understanding?</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Chapter Three: Methodology</strong></p>
  <p><strong>3.1 Participants</strong><br>
      The participants of the study will include forty&#8211;two freshmen students
      (all males) in one of the most prestigious senior high schools in central
      Taiwan. Their English proficiency level is intermediate-high with an average
      score of X in the BCT English test. They will be in the second semester
      of the two-semester freshman year. The objective of the program is to provide
      the students with opportunities to communicate with native speakers of
      English
      by fully exerting their English skills through the CMC activities between
      their school on Taiwan and the High school in U.K.</p>
  <p><strong>3.2 Partners</strong><br>
      The partners in U.K. are thirty students in a girls&#8217; high school
      in Surrey, London. The two schools had started a partnership since 2007.
      For
        the past two years, the students in both schools have been engaged in
      the exchange of both science and literature projects through a variety
      of CMC
        activities. Since the partners are native speakers of English, their
      proficiency level is relatively higher than that of the students on the
      Taiwan side.
        Their interest in the exchange program has been in promoting the cultural
        understanding between students in both countries.</p>
  <p><strong>3.3 Instruments</strong><br>
      <strong>3.3.1 CMC Activity Attitude Questionnaire</strong><br>
      There will be a pre-test and pro-test of a CMC activity attitude questionnaire
          before and after the exchange program. The questionnaire is intended
          to gather information about the students&#8217; attitudes toward the
          activities, their responses to the exchange program and whether they
          perceive an improvement
          in their English skills. To achieve this goal, the items in the questionnaire
          will be categorized into the following sections: 1) their general attitudes
          toward the program. 2) their perceived improvement in the four language
          skills respectively. 3) the enhancement of their understanding of both
          cultures.
          4) their evaluation and comments of the activities respectively and
          5) the effects of the activities on their English learning motivation
          and attitudes.</p>
  <p><strong>3.3.2 Post-activity Written Feedback</strong><br>
      To generate sufficient specific details about the participants&#8217; perceptions
            about the CMC activities, they will be required to keep record of
      their reflections by leaving text massages in the guestbook on the Website
      at least five times
            during the period and finish a self-report after each videoconference
      sessions. The focus of their written feedback will be centred on the descriptions
      of
            their personal opinions about a specific activity in the program,
      such as the pleasure they have derived from their participation in the
      project or
            the difficulty they have encountered during the exchange experiences.      </p>
  <p><strong>3.3.3 Semi-constructed Interview</strong><br>
      A semi-conducted interview will be conducted after the three month
              of exchange program, transcribed and then analyzed. The interview
              will be
              directed
              under the theme of the five categories listed in the questionnaire
              so as to ensure
              its function as data for triangulation.</p>
  <p><strong>3.4 Procedures</strong><br>
      The participants will participate in a wide variety of CMC activities
                with the British partners through a group-based team work. During
                the three
                month period, the participants will engage in the following activities:
                1) e-mailing
                for building up group-to group communication relationship 2)
        participating in the exchange projects on science and literature 3) video-conferencing
                sessions and 4) exchanging and sharing their products of language
                learning by posting group works on the website. They will be
        divided
                into 6
                groups and matched with the student groups from the school in
        U.K. The members
                of each group will correspond to those in another group from
        the other side
                by e-mailing as teamwork for six weeks. The correspondence will
                be separated into two sessions, each of which will last for 3
        weeks. During the first
                session, they are advised to communicate with each other mainly
                about
                the assigned topic while corresponding to each other. Then, they
                will be encouraged
                to choose the topic to their own interest during the following
                correspondence session for the purpose of building a sound communication
                relationship.
                In addition, each student will be required to give their ideas,
                responses, or
                personal thoughts by leaving text massages in the guest book
        in the web-site for five times at least. Finally, each group will
                choose
                a desired reading
                material and do the reading within limited time period. And each
                group has to produce a Power Point file to present the main ideas
                of the
                reading material
                and their comment and reflections. The content has to include
        the following items: brief introduction, summary, personal reflections,
                and questions
                for discussion. The groups on the other side will do likewise.
                Finally, they
                will post their group work on the web-site and exchange views
        on
                the reading material first. Then, they will be ready for a series
                of videoconferencing.</p>
  <p>After the collaboration project, the subjects
                will be asked to write a report on the participation of this
                project and answer
                a questionnaire
                about taking
                part in this project. Next, the researcher will collect relevant
                data and
                student responses and do quantitative and qualitative analysis.
                Finally, the researcher will further summarize and discuss the
                findings of
                the study.</p>
  <p><strong>3.5 Data Analysis</strong><br>
      The attitudinal questionnaires will be administered before and
                  after the videoconferencing sessions and then collected for
        further analysis
                  (T-test)
                  by using S.S.P.S. The data collected from the students&#8217; written feedback
                  and the semi-structured interviews will also be organized, summarized and
                  analyzed for triangulation. </p>
