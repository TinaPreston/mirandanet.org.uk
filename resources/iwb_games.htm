  <h2>Community Cohesion 3: Creating and Using Interactive Whiteboard Games</h2>

  <p><strong><a href="http://www.holycross.kingston.sch.uk/"><img src="images/holycross_school_logo.jpg" alt="Holy Cross School" width="100" height="98" class="imageRight" title="Holy Cross School"></a></strong></p>
  <h3>Creating and Using Interactive Whiteboard Games</h3>

      <strong>Paul Sebuliba:</strong>      NHS, Kingston, UK<br>

      <strong>Lawrence Williams</strong>:
      Head of Creative Development at The Holy Cross School, Surrey, UK</p>
    <p><em>The project described here is the third in a series of cross-agency 
      (now called <a href="cc_index.htm">Community Cohesion</a>) explorations 
      involving the development of resources for, and by, people with learning 
      disabilities. (See &#8220;<a href="healthy_eating.htm">Healthy 
      Eating</a>&#8221; JAT December 2008, and &#8220;<a href="keeping_safe.htm">Keeping 
      Safe</a>&#8221; JAT June 2010.) Year 7 students at the Holy Cross secondary 
      girls&#8217; school devised a series of simple educational games, for use 
      on an interactive whiteboard, to support the learning of young adult students. 
      The completed resources were then further developed at Lambeth College, 
      and were finally made available for use both by Lambeth College and NHS 
      Kingston&#8217;s Occupational Therapy Service for people with learning disabilities.</em></p>
  <p><strong><img src="images/lambeth_college.gif" alt="Lambeth College" width="52" height="104" class="imageRight" title="Lambeth College">The Team and its Aims</strong><br>
    The participants in the project were Lambeth College, who commissioned the
      initial project, and the Holy Cross School, whose students created the
      interactive games. NHS Kingston developed a file format for the games in
      partnership with Lambeth College, whose students visited Holy Cross to
    share the final outcomes.</p>
  <p>The aim of the project was to use PowerPoint files to create a series of
    simple educational games for use on an interactive white board. These would
    be designed to meet the learning requirements of people with learning disabilities,
    as well as being presented in a visually accessible way. Reference was made
    throughout the project to the &#8220;Visual Impairment Tips&#8221; sheet
    provided to the school by NHS Kingston. This publication gives advice on
    using suitable fonts, and the principles of appropriate layout devices.</p>
  <p><strong>Project development</strong><br>
    Year 7 students at Holy Cross began work on the project by creating their
      own individual PowerPoint files on a topic of their choice. This pilot
      project was added so that the girls could explore the possibilities offered
      by the computer program, and to make suitably colourful and entertaining
      games. Topics chosen included mathematical skills, as well as several games
      on colour and shape. Class discussions and planning centred on how to make
      logically sequenced hyperlinks between the various pages of the game, in
      order to take the user effectively through the learning process, to a successful
    conclusion.</p>
  <p><img src="images/iwb1.jpg" alt="Click on the right colour game" title="Click on the right colour game" width="384" height="288" class="imageRight">Once the students were confident about the logical structure of their games,
    and were sure about the visual clarity needed by the end users, the school
    invited Paul Sebuliba, from NHS Kingston, to visit the classroom in order
    to support the Year 7 students, and to check the work done so far. He looked
    at the students&#8217; pilot games, and gave useful individual feedback on
    the project. </p>
  <p>The Specialist Health Occupational Therapy Service for Adults with Learning
    Disabilities contributed through developing the design template for the power
    point presentations. This was then shared and agreed with the Lambeth College
    Tutor to ensure that the final template would meet the needs of both the
    OT Service and Lambeth College Learning Development Department.</p>
  <p><strong>The template and design principles</strong><br>
    Lorian Mead on behalf of the Occupational Therapy Service then developed
      a presentation for the Holy Cross students. The presentation covered the
      key aspects of designing for adults with learning disabilities, including
      a template (see below). Consideration was given to the page layout, so
    that information could be confined to a sequence of two images. </p>
  <p><img src="images/iwb2.jpg" alt="Photo Options template" title="Photo Options template" width="576" height="433"></p>
  <p>The amount of information being provided was considered important in order
    that people using the final PowerPoint were not overloaded. The development
    stages of communication were also considered. Photos are a useful support
    at an early graphically representational stage, and as such meet the needs
    of many people with learning disabilities. However, the choice of photos
    is crucial, as images need to represent the object clearly. Therefore the
    presentation for the game-makers also included examples of a clear and accessible
    image, compared to a less clear and cluttered image.</p>
  <p>As the majority of people with learning disabilities have some form of visual
    impairment, the design of the template also included the incorporation of
    key elements that would enable people with visual impairments to participate
    in the games. These principles include a large font size and a yellow background
    to the text. It was also recommended that a contrasting colour is used for
    the text e.g. black.</p>
  <p>The actual font being used was also important as some fonts use letters
    that are not easily recognisable, if the reader is at an early stage of reading
    ability. For example, the letter &#8216;a&#8217; looks different in cambria
    font to comic sans font. Comic sans font is one of the fonts that is recommended
    for use with adults with learning disabilities. </p>
  <p><strong>Creating the interactive games</strong><br>
    The next step was the creation of the actual games which would be used not
      only by the students at Lambeth College, but also by NHS professionals.
      These games were designed to create options for the users to click on,
      to advance the slides either to a correct, or an incorrect, choice of answer.
      The Holy Cross students took sequences of digital pictures, at home, to
      use in their individual game. Following the design brief for NHS Kingston,
      they had to ensure that the sequences were clear, logical, and were presented
    in an appropriate size, and with a suitable font</p>
  <p>Topics required for the project were focussed on everyday tasks such as
    the correct sequence needed for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>brushing your teeth thoroughly </li>
    <li>making a cup of tea</li>
    <li>ironing clothes safely</li>
    <li>buttering bread</li>
    <li>feeding a dog</li>
  </ul>
<p>Following their completion by the Holy Cross students, the files were sent
    to Lambeth College, where students and their teachers trialled them, and
    gave feedback on these games. Lloyd Mead sent the following comments:</p>
<p><em>The
    Lambeth College students enjoyed doing all of the activities, and the layout
    and appearance of all the presentations was of a good level, and visually
      accessible.</em></p>
<p><em>Some excellent examples of this are:</em></p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Olivia&#8217;s slide 3, good, with
    clear pictures and layout</em></li>
  <li><em>Constance's whole &#8220;teeth&#8221; sequence
      is excellent. Nice clear pictures and clear big writing in Comic Sans font.</em></li>
  <li><em>The
      students liked to hear the clapping sound file played to them when they
    did well. Anne and Nicole&#8217;s sound files were particularly
          appreciated.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Refinements to the games</strong><br>
    The next step in the project was for Lambeth students and teachers to refine
      the games at the College. Because the files are in electronic format, they
    can easily be adjusted according to the needs of the end user.</p>
  <p>The Lambeth college students picked the best of the samples that had been
    sent and set about practising playing the games on the interactive white
    board, on three separate occasions. Through observing the students playing
    the games, and through subsequent conversation with the students about the
    problems that they had, changes were made to the games to make them work
    well for this particular student group. For example, where pictures had been
    taken from the Internet some still had imbedded hyperlinks in them that would
    take the students to an external website when the picture was clicked. It
    was these hyperlinks that were removed, as the some students clicked on all
    the pictures. Another feature that caused difficulties for the students was
    that PowerPoint documents have a default setting to go to the next page when
    the current page is clicked. If the student clicked on the page and not the
    hyperlink, a different page from the one they had intended would come next.
    To resolve this default box on the slide transition &#8216;Advance slide&#8217; needed
    to be unchecked so the page would only advance though a hyperlink. Some of
    the hyperlinks were small and it was recommended that they were enlarged
    to make it easier for the students to touch or click. On one game the hyperlinks
    were next to each other, and during the trialling a student knew the right
    answer but got the wrong hyperlink, so it was recommended that these were
    moved apart. </p>
  <p>Once these changes had been made, the Lambeth college students visited the
    Holy Cross School. Year 7 girls presented the required changes that had been
    made to their work, and the Lambeth College students, along with the Holy
    Cross students, played the refined and completed games on the interactive
    white board. The final games have continued to be used by the college students
    on the Independent Living Skills course. The students have also used the
    games on the interactive whiteboard, as a group, to reinforce the skills
    of team working and problem solving developed during the project </p>

  <p><strong>Above, a Holy Cross Y7 student shares a moment of fun with Lloyd Mead, and
    his students from Lambeth College. Her IWB game is on the interactive white
    board behind them.</strong></p>
  <p>Lloyd comments,<em> &#8220;Taking part in this project has been a great
      opportunity and to my students to build confidence in giving feed back
      on the games.
    They have found the method motivating and the games have provided an opportunity
    to develop their skills and knowledge of this information technology. For
    me, it has been the opportunity, also, to consolidate skills in the use of
    interactive white boards. I have also learnt more about strategies for introducing
    and engaging students to this technology. I am now using this PowerPoint
    template with the college students, using pictures of the students doing
    activities such as cooking to make sequencing games which can be used to
    reinforce the initial learning in the kitchen. This project has led me to
    research further how interactive white boards can be used to promote learning.&#8221; </em></p>
  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
    This has, once again, been an interesting and successful project. Holy Cross
      students had the opportunity to be creative as part of their normal ICT
      lessons at the school. Their work had a practical purpose, as well as developing
      their ICT and creative skills. Lambeth College students were able to trial
      the games, and to provide important feedback on their practical use. They
      continue to enjoy using the materials. NHS Kingston developed their understanding
      of how schools work, supported the project with professional input, and
      gained useful training materials for service users, as an intervention
    to support the development of life skills.</p>
