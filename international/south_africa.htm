    Schools</a> | <a href="#iwb"> Interactive Whiteboards</a> | <a href="#visiting">Visiting 
    Free State</a></p>
  <p>I&#8217;m hardly an expert on South Africa after my first visit to Free State 
    last November &#8230; but perhaps some comments from a new comer might encourage 
    you in the national miracle you are achieving little by little.</p>
  <p>Almost all the news we hear in England about South Africa is about crime, 
    Aids and despair. However, I soon found out on my arrival that our media have 
    not been able to bottle the South African sense of hope and determination 
    that I found amongst my Free State colleagues, despite the formidable difficulties 
    that they face. And I think that it is that human spirit, the Mandela legacy, 
    that will be the ingredient that carries you forward when better funded nations 
    give up the struggle to make the world a better place.</p>
  <p>In fact, you may be able to offer some direction to the English, especially 
    the young people who are widely troubled by the example of our politicians 
    who have followed the Americans into a controversial war in Iraq. For the 
    first time in many a year millions of ordinary English people, including our 
    school children, have been sufficiently outraged to march on the streets and 
    protest against our government&#8217;s decision. </p>
  <p>You will understand the kind of emotions that force people to participate 
    in their nation&#8217;s affairs. But the English have enjoyed the warm glow 
    of a reasonably fair society for several decades, and this is new to us. English 
    politicians may be in danger of being complacent about what an inclusive democracy 
    really means, whereas in South Africa you are facing this issue every day. 
    I found the atmosphere invigorating. </p>
  <p>[<a href="#top">Back to the top</a>]</p>
  <h3><a name="spreading"></a>Spreading Fellowship between teachers </h3>
  <p>Since the late eighties I have been working in a range of countries to bring 
    computers into education as a means of increasing democratic participation 
    and promoting collaborative and constructive learning and independent study. 
  </p>
  <p>Some of the countries where I work, which have had right and left wing dictatorships 
    in the past, are struggling to encourage their citizens to engage in their 
    new democratic power. The apathy of citizens is a real challenge in many countries. 
    Many of these colleagues from education in countries like Brazil, Bulgaria, 
    Chile, China, the Czech Republic and Russia have joined the international 
    MirandaNet Fellowship which I founded in 1992 to draw strength from abroad. 
  </p>
  <p>Our specialism is to develop communities of teachers, teacher educators, 
    policy makers and company representatives who support each other face-to-face 
    and online in sharing cultural diversity. Teachers and teacher educators publish 
    web based case studies about using computers to transform teaching and learning. 
    We also run practice based courses face to face and online which give the 
    participants formal qualifications which are internationally accredited for 
    the work they have done in the class room and the staff room. There are now 
    twenty five MirandaNet chapters around the world which each bring their local 
    flavour to our organization.</p>
  <p>Since the events of 9/11 and the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, 
    MirandaNet Fellows have been reporting children&#8217;s growing sense of fear 
    and insecurity as well as their concern about intolerance of others. In response 
    we raised the money to built a web space called World Ecitizens, a safe place 
    where young learners can work together across cultural borders. In the closed 
    we environment they can upload resources and work on joint projects. The gallery 
    provides a place for pupils&#8217; voices. (<a href="https://wec.mirandanet.org.uk/">www.worldecitizens.net</a>)</p>
  <p>Already in the World Ecitizens gallery we have Peace Posters and poems from 
    English six year olds and a graphic novel called Living from 10 and 11 year 
    olds who were distressed regarding the issue of homelessness on London streets. 
    Other imaginative and creative new projects are underway. We hope that South 
    African pupils will want to contribute, and maybe to work with their peers 
    across the world. Every student who contributes gets a certificate to welcome 
    them as a World Ecitizen.</p>
  <p>[<a href="#top">Back to the top</a>]</p>
  <h3><a name="what"></a>What are computers for?</h3>
  <p>World Ecitizenship is a grand aim. But of course, over thirty years, we have 
    found in England that computers in education can be helpful in more mundane 
    requirements like coping with teacher shortages, serving special needs and 
    raising educational standards (<a href="http://www.becta.org.uk/research">www.becta.org.uk/research</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.becta.org.uk/impact2">www.becta.org.uk/impact2</a>).</p>
  <p>Computers are a compulsory part of the English national curriculum (<a href="http://www.nc.uk.net/">www.nc.uk.net</a>). 
    All our schools have broadband access to the Internet and thousands of multimedia 
    curriculum resources to download many of them designed by teachers (<a href="http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk">www.curriculumonline.gov.uk</a>). 
    All these materials are free on the web to teachers from other countries so 
    you may want to dip in.</p>
  <p>In addition we are now engaged on a national consultation with all interested 
    parties about what we really want from our government&#8217;s unified elearning 
    strategy (<a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/elearningstrategy/">www.dfes.gov.uk/elearningstrategy</a>). 
    This document will help you to understand the elearning concept better. South 
    Africans can make a head start in defining and pursuing the best that elearning 
    has to offer for your kind of nation where there is rural poverty and lack 
    of access to learning materials. We have put points of community access in 
    our local libraries. If you can organize the security issues putting the Internet 
    in local schools and colleges for the use of local communities and businesses 
    may help to empower them. </p>
  <p>In our schools we are planning an exciting new curriculum for our 11-14 year 
    olds who sometimes find traditional school approaches boring. The new challenges 
    include computer activities that they can enjoy. To make this valuable to 
    their working lives we are also reconsidering how we assess the ability of 
    these young people and trying to find ways of celebrating skills other than 
    reading and writing (<a href="http://www.qca.org.uk/">www.qca.org.uk</a>). 
  </p>
  <p>This is probably our most innovatory and risky step since it challenges the 
    traditional system that has worked so well for so long. But the world needs 
    all kinds of people now. Not just the good readers and the writers with excellent 
    memories, but the collaborators, the innovators, the dancers, the singers, 
    the risk takers and the peacemakers. How will we know where to find them if 
    we do not give them a chance to shine in school and reward them with high 
    grades? Can we go on making eighty per cent of our population feel that they 
    have failed?</p>
  <p>In this case the ICT in Schools division of the government is somewhat ahead 
    of some of the teaching profession. The ICT in Schools, Department for Education 
    and Skills report, &#8216;Fulfilling the Potential&#8217; which describes 
    what is meant by transforming teaching and learning is not yet fully understood 
    by all the teaching profession (<a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/ictinschools/publications">www.dfes.gov.uk/ictinschools/publications</a>). 
  </p>
  <p>I have just completed the research into the lessons from the national ICT 
    Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programme from 1999-2003. The &pound;230 
    million cost of this national programme was funded from the Lottery National 
    Opportunities Fund. The ICT education community seems to have moved forward 
    after this exercise in terms of skills and understanding about computers, 
    but there are still questions for the profession to resolve about what exactly 
    the transformation of learning means at international, national and local 
    levels and how teachers can be helped to take ownership of this concept. (<a href="../tta/index.html">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/tta</a>)</p>
  <p>[<a href="#top">Back to the top</a>]</p>
  <h3><a name="bringing"></a>Bringing computers into South African Schools</h3>
  <p>As far as computers in education go, the English situation must seem idyllic 
    compared to South Africa. Of course I know that in the farm schools and the 
    townships there are access challenges that have to be met full on. I have 
    worried about my work in poor countries myself, in case I am diverting cash 
    which is required for more pressing needs. But my colleagues on the ground 
    have assured me that bread and water alone will not suffice. Countries on 
    the cusp of change need technology as well as bread and water they tell me 
    in order to catch up with the world economy and understand the issues. </p>
  <p>What you have already in your favour is an excellent South African outcomes-based 
    curriculum and a manifesto on Values, Education and Democracy which is much 
    clear in its aims for democracy (<a href="http://education.pwv.gov.za">http://education.pwv.gov.za</a>). 
    You also have some excellent computer practice and experience, especially 
    in the Western Cape and in many ISASA schools who are leading the way. To 
    your credit, you have already made the hardest change of all in implementing 
    democracy without bloodshed, and you also have many friends in the world who 
    truly want to help. </p>
  <p>In our experience it is your teachers who will need the most support to lead 
    the use of elearning technologies in schools. We have found that portable 
    computers for teachers are very important to gain their intellectual commitment 
    and allow them access to the Internet. Ownership of laptops also reduces the 
    need for expensive basic skills training as well, but does not eliminate the 
    need. Continuing professional development is also essential, but has to suit 
    the learning styles of the teachers who are all different and be rooted in 
    classroom change . Web publishing case studies shares the experience and stores 
    professional knowledge.</p>
  <p>Digital cameras, datalogging equipment and personal digital assistants (PDAs) 
    are more inexpensive routes to explore to start the elearning habit. What 
    MirandaNet Fellows have also found is the most transformational single tool 
    is the Interactive Whiteboard (IWB) which can be used by teachers and students 
    alike to present interactive computer technology to whole classes. The software 
    provided by the company is a very important consideration and not easy to 
    check for effectiveness. The English department for Education and Skills is 
    now funding a large national project to ensure that IWBs are widely used in 
    schools.</p>
  <p>[<a href="#top">Back to the top</a>]</p>
  <h3><a name="iwb"></a>Interactive Whiteboards: new tools, new pedagogies, new 
    learning?</h3>
  <p>My colleague, Dr John Cuthell, who has been a MirandaNet Fellow for about 
    ten years explains more about the IWB project he has been developing:</p>
  <p>During 2002 Promethean and MirandaNet have been developing an IWB project 
    collaborated to examine the impact that interactive whiteboards had made on 
    teaching and learning in schools. The first phase of the project was completed 
    at the end of 2002 and published for the BETT exhibition at Olympia, London. 
    The evidence collected was arranged thematically. </p>
  <p>Case studies from this first phase explore the ways in which interactive 
    whiteboards are used, and the ways in which they contribute to student learning 
    and teacher pedagogies. They&#8217;re in no way definitive: what they offer 
    is shared experience, and the beginning of a Community of Practice. (<a href="http://www.mirandanorth.org.uk/whiteboards.html">www.mirandanorth.org.uk/whiteboards.html</a>)</p>
  <p>As more schools are fitted with interactive whiteboards there is a real need 
    for teachers to play an active role in specifying the ways in which this extremely 
    powerful tool is installed and used. The technology can effect a profound 
    change in the ways in which our students learn, the ways in which we teach 
    and, more fundamentally, the ways in which we organise the curriculum and 
    our schools.</p>
  <p>When teachers are expected to respond to so many conflicting demands &#8211; 
    social regulation versus radical change; transforming teaching versus raising 
    standards: and when the audience for learning has expanded beyond the teacher 
    &#8211; student relationship, these case studies may provide some ideas for 
    hard-pressed colleagues.</p>
  <p>During 2003 the work was extended, and seven teachers from schools across 
    the country participated in an action research project funded by Promethean 
    and directed by MirandaNet. Three workshops were held at the Institute of 
    Education, London, and two seminars at the University of Huddersfield. The 
    projects covered all the Key Stages. An online survey of teacher responses 
    to interactive whiteboards ran in parallel with the action research projects.</p>
  <p>Three distinct threads emerged from the research:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the need for a planned approach to the infrastructure and ICT skills that 
      were needed when interactive whiteboards were introduced;</li>
    <li>the identification of all of the curriculum concepts involved in the teaching;</li>
    <li>affective changes in staff and students engendered by effective use of 
      interactive whiteboards.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thanks are due to the Promethean educational teams for their support throughout 
    the project which we believe is a good example of how companies and teachers 
    can learn together.</p>
  <p>MirandaNet Fellows have been engaged in working in projects over the years 
    with other companies like Apple, Actis, BBC, Oracle, Microsoft, Toshiba and 
    many others who pay the teachers expenses to carry out classroom research 
    into teaching and learning. The British Suppliers Association has been particularly 
    active in South Africa already. Teacher researcher working with companies 
    is one of the ideas we would all like to pursue in supporting South Africa&#8217;s 
    progress in learning.</p>
  <p>[<a href="#top">Back to the top</a>]</p>
  <h3><a name="visiting"></a>Visiting Free State</h3>
  <p>I took two MirandaNet colleagues to Free State with me, Mark Bennison who 
    is a deputy head in a secondary school and Mara Chrystie who headed a primary 
    school. We hope to make many more connections and we have begun by creating 
    a website about our observations and aspirations as a thank you for the warm 
    welcome we received. </p>
  <p> <img src="../images/tp_in_sa.jpg" alt="Tina in South Africa" title="Tina in South Africa" class="imageRight">We 
    had heard before our visit that the birds fly upside down over Free State 
    because there is nothing to see. You will see that our web site bird thinks 
    differently (<a href="http://www.mrbennison.com/mirandanet">http://www.mrbennison.com/mirandanet</a>)</p>
  <p>Here&#8217;s hoping this visit will be the start of a stimulating co-operation 
    between the MirandaNet Fellowship and South Africa ?</p>
