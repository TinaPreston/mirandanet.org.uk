    <h3>&#8220;How do you set up an on-line project with teachers in another country, 
      such as China?&#8221;</h3>
    <p>Lawrence Williams<br>
      Assistant Head Teacher, The Holy Cross School, Surrey, UK<br>
      Lead Practitioner in ICT, Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT)</p>
    <p>This is a question that we are frequently asked, and it was suggested by 
      SSAT that examples of edited correspondence, showing how ideas and projects 
      are developed should be published on the web.<em> Approval to publish was 
      sought and gained form Beijing.</em></p>
    <p class="centeredImage"><img src="ukchina/LW_at_work.jpg" alt="Wang Wei, rear, middle (in green) and Lawrence Williams, rear right" title="Wang Wei, rear, middle (in green) and Lawrence Williams, rear right" width="600" height="450"></p>
    <p>What follows here is a sequence of emails leading us to the above picture. 
      At the meeting were educators from several groups: Holy Cross School in 
      south London; Beijing Academy of Educational Sciences; Beijing Normal University; 
      and Shijizhuang College. Also present were teachers from several schools 
      in Beijing.</p>
    <p>Following this is a further set of emails showing how the curriculum content 
      of some of the project was developed</p>
    <p>The emails were sent during July and September 2006.</p>
    <h4>Getting Started</h4>
    <p>The correspondence relates to communication between me and Wang Wei, a 
      researcher, in lime green, seated second from the left.</p>
    <h4> Setting up the meeting in Beijing</h4>
    <p><img src="ukchina/learningtogether.gif" alt="Learning Together" title="Learning Together" width="180" height="63"></p>
    <p>Following an email to Wang Wei, a researcher at Beijing Academy of Educational 
      Sciences, and whose email address was found on the MirandaNet web site, 
      www.mirandanet.ac.uk. Wang Wei kindly referred me to a Mr. Zhang at School 
      No.50. I replied as follows:</p>
    <p><em>Dear Wang Wei,</em></p>
    <p>I am pleased to inform you that I have made very useful contact with Mr. 
      Zhang at Beijing No. 50 School, as you kindly suggested, and we are developing 
      plans to collaborate by email, the internet, and video-conferencing. Thank 
      you for your kind introduction.</p>
    <p>The plan is that School No. 50 will be working with me, from September, 
      to develop science education and cross-curricular work in the &#8220;Science 
      Through Arts&#8221; Project, which I created with the support of my colleagues 
      at NASA, Cleveland, Ohio, USA. I recently asked my STAR co-directors, Ruth 
      Petersen, and Pathfinder scientist, Joseph Kolecki, to welcome School No. 
      50 into STAR, and I am pleased to inform you that this has now been done. 
      School 50 is the first Chinese school to become involved in STAR.</p>
    <p>I am aware that cross-curricular work is new, and so I shall be very happy 
      to guide Mr. Zhang, and his excellent school and teachers in this new way 
      of using ICT tools to support science learning. NASA scientists see this 
      cross-curricular method of working as the way forward for science education 
      in the new millennium.</p>
    <p>As I mentioned, I shall be in Beijing on Monday 14th August. You have kindly 
      informed me that the schools and colleges have a vacation at this time, 
      and it will not be possible for me to lecture at your university, but I 
      should still warmly welcome the opportunity to meet some of your teacher-trainers, 
      if this at all possible. You will see from my signature file that my school 
      is officially designated by the UK Government to train teachers, and one 
      part of our &quot;Outreach Programme&quot; is to share good practice with 
      teacher-trainers in other countries. I have just returned from a lecture 
      tour of Macedonia, where I saw many computers donated by your own government 
      to support ICT learning there. It is a small world. My visit to Macedonia 
      would not have been so successful without the generosity of the Chinese 
      government</p>
    <p>If, therefore, any of your teacher-trainers were available to visit me 
      at the Plaza Hotel on the evening of Monday 14th August, I should be very 
      pleased to share the pedagogy that underpins our work in ICT education. 
      Perhaps next year, I might also be able to work with your trainee-teacher 
      students as well.</p>
    <p>Thank you, once again, for your kind introduction for me to work with School 
      No. 50.</p>
    <p>Warmest regards,</p>
    <p><em>Lawrence</em></p>
    <h4>Following confirmation of hotel accommodation in Beijing:</h4>
    <p><em>Dear Lawrence</em></p>
    <p>It is good to hear from you. We are looking forward to meeting you, too.</p>
    <p>As to booking a suitable conference room at the Plaza Hotel, I think it 
      is no problem. But I have some thing to confirm with you.</p>
    <p>1. Let me know the Chinese name of the hotel you will stay in Beijing, 
      because I did not know &#8220;The Plaza Hotel&#8221; at all. Could you tell 
      me the telephone number or more information about the Plaza Hotel?</p>
    <p>2. You are going to arrive on Monday 14th August in Beijing and you will 
      be in Beijing for two weeks, which is a fully organized tour. I want to 
      know when you would like to meet us. Will we meet and discuss with you on 
      Monday evening 14th August or Tuesday evening 15th August? Or another time? 
      Please tell me your preferred time of the conference, and then I will book 
      the conference room. You may be tired after arriving in Beijing.</p>
    <p> 3. We have 5-6 English teachers from the secondary schools to meet you. 
      What will we do for you?</p>
    <p> Keep in touch</p>
    <p>Regards,</p>
    <p><em>Wang Wei</em></p>
    <h4>Sharing a vision of education:</h4>
    <p><em>Dear Wang Wei,</em></p>
    <p>Thank you most sincerely for your very kind help in making these arrangements.</p>
    <p>I look forward to meeting you and your colleagues.</p>
    <p>My wife, Susan, who is also a secondary school teacher, will be with me. 
      She, too, wishes to link with a school in China.</p>
    <p>Susan has lectured, with me, about ICT education in Skopje and Bitola Universities, 
      Macedonia, and also has taught at Baylor University, Texas, USA. She is 
      MirandaNet Fellow, like most of us!</p>
    <p>At the meeting, there may also be a Mr. Gao, from Shijiazhuang College, 
      who is a colleague of Professor Margaret Cox, at King&#8217;s College, London 
      University, who kindly introduced us, by email. It may be that Shijiazhuang 
      College will be able to link with Susan&#8217;s school in London.</p>
    <p>My own interests are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Science Through Arts, a project with NASA</li>
  <li>Cross-curricular uses of ICT</li>
  <li>International collaborations</li>
  <li>Teacher training in ICT education</li>
  <li>World peace, through bringing the children of the world together in peaceful 
    understanding</li>
  <li>My wife&#8217;s interests are in business and enterprise, and the teaching 
    of English.</li>
</ul>
    <p>Please forward this email to those whom you think these notes may interest.</p>
    <p>I am sure that this is the start of some important new forms of collaboration 
      between our two counties, and I thank you once again for you assistance.</p>
    <p>Regards,</p>
    <p><em>Lawrence</em><br>
      PS Our flight number from Heathrow Airport is CA 938, arriving in Beijing 
      at 13.15, leaving, I hope, plenty of time for a 17.00 meeting.</p>
    <p><em>Dear Lawrence</em></p>
    <p>I am looking forward to meeting you and your wife in Beijing. And our schools 
      are glad to link with your wife&#8217;s school, which is good news for us. 
      I will arrange 4-5 teachers to meet you, who are from 2-3 secondary schools 
      in Beijing.</p>
    <p>By the way my interests are E-learning and E-teaching, international collaborations 
      on ICT in basic education. Now I am doing an educational project, which 
      is the research about E-learning in primary schools and secondary schools. 
      We wish to collaborate with you.</p>
    <p>See you soon.</p>
    <p><em>Wang Wei</em></p>
    <h4>Practical issues</h4>
    <p> <em>Dear Wang Wei,</em></p>
    <p>Thank you for your kind support of my visit to Beijing.</p>
    <p>Thank you also for helping with arrangements for the planned meeting at 
      my hotel.</p>
    <p>I am working, this week, at Surrey University, on an international Science 
      Workshop, and do not have access to my home files. From the Internet, however, 
      the Plaza Hotel is at:</p>
    <p>100 Dongsanhuan Nanlu, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100021, China</p>
    <p>There is no telephone number on the web page.</p>
    <p>Please check that they are planning to receive a tour party, for two weeks, 
      from the United Kingdom, organized by:</p>
    <p>Voyages Jules Verne (based in London)</p>
    <p>We arrive at Beijing airport on 13.10 on Monday 14th.</p>
    <p>Allowing for some delay at the airport, I should be at the hotel by about 
      16.00 and ready to talk at 16.30, for as long as you like!</p>
    <p>I am not worried about tiredness from the journey. I enjoy my work and 
      will truly enjoy meeting like-minded educators, in an exciting new country.</p>
    <p>On the Tuesday morning, we are whisked off to see the Great Wall of China, 
      and will be kept moving for the next 13 days!</p>
    <p>Thank you once again for your kindness.</p>
    <p><em>Lawrence</em></p>
    <p><em>Dear Wang Wei,</em></p>
    <p>It sounds as if our interests are very much the same.</p>
    <p>I have a wide range of helpful contacts in the UK, including the British 
      Council, so I am sure we will be able to support a number of schools in 
      China in obtaining links with schools in the UK. No problem.</p>
    <p>You may have heard about severe terrorist difficulties at London Airport, 
      but we are not going to be influenced by this. We will come, even if we 
      have to WALK! You may want to check flight arrival times with the Beijing 
      Airport, though, in case there is a delay.</p>
    <p>With best wishes and thanks,</p>
    <p><em>Lawrence and Susan</em></p>
    <h4>More practicalities</h4>
    <p><em>Hello, Lawrence</em></p>
    <p>Yesterday I had contacted with the Plaza Hotel by telephone and booked 
      the meeting room for our conversation from 17:00 to 21:00 on Monday 14th.</p>
    <p>I and my colleagues will wait for you in the lobby at 17:00 on Monday 14th 
      and I will take a booklet signed &#8220;MirandaNet&#8221; in my hand in 
      order to be identify us.</p>
    <p>I appended the photo which is of Tina Preston and me.</p>
    <p>Regards,</p>
    <p><em>Wang Wei</em></p>
    <h4>This made the meeting in Beijing possible. Next follows the setting up 
      of the curriculum details.</h4>
    <p><em>Dear Wang Wei,</em></p>
    <p>I had an error message from my email server saying that the attachment 
      would not travel.</p>
    <p>Here is the text in the body of the email, minus the picture.....</p>
    <p>Links with China</p>
    <p>The first meeting with our Beijing colleagues</p>
    <p>On Monday 14th August, 2006, Lawrence Williams and his wife, Susan, arranged 
      to meet a number of teachers and teacher educators in the conference room 
      at the Plaza Hotel, in Beijing. The aim of the meeting was to see in what 
      ways Susan&#8217;s school, Raynes Park High School, a Technology College 
      in Merton, and Lawrence&#8217;s school, The Holy Cross School, a Science 
      College in Kingston, could work together on international projects using 
      email and video-conferencing equipment.</p>
    <p>Arriving straight off the London to Beijing flight, Lawrence and Susan 
      were immediately engaged in a three-hour discussion about how ICT tools 
      are used in UK schools to support learning. Led by Wang Wei, (second from 
      the right in the picture) the Chinese group consisted of teachers at Beijing 
      Normal (Teacher Training) University, from Beijing Academy of Educational 
      Sciences, and from the city of Shijizhuang College, which is located about 
      100k from Beijing.<br>
      Also present were teachers from two Beijing schools, School No. 50 (a secondary 
      school) and School No. 27 (a middle school).</p>
    <p>From a laptop, Lawrence showed a range of his Year 8 and 9 students&#8217; 
      ICT work and copies of these files, as requested by the group, were left 
      with the teachers as exemplar work. Lawrence also presented copies of his 
      Collected Papers in ICT Education.</p>
    <p>Following this introduction, the group divided into two sections for more 
      detailed discussions of how Raynes Park will work with Beijing No.27 to 
      develop work under the &#8220;Enterprise&#8221; heading, and Holy Cross 
      will work with Beijing No. 50 to develop cross-curricular learning, including 
      an introduction to the NASA/ Holy Cross &#8220;Science Through Arts&#8221; 
      Project.</p>
    <p>The meeting was extremely fruitful, and Wang Wei, the group leader in Beijing, 
      very warmly invited Lawrence and Susan to join her and her colleagues for 
      a special Chinese meal at the hotel, including several dishes which she 
      had kindly selected herself.</p>
    <p>We plan to build on the success of this meeting during the coming months, 
      working to develop both school to school links, as well as supporting new 
      ideas in ICT teaching and learning at the Chinese teacher training colleges.</p>
    <p><em>Dear Wang Wei,</em></p>
    <p>It was a great pleasure to meet you in Beijing. We were grateful for your 
      kind hospitality.</p>
    <p>I have worked out a project in which you might be interested, using one 
      half of a class that I shall be teaching, starting next week.</p>
    <p>It seems to me that Chinese teachers would enjoy developing their English 
      language skills, so this project is designed with this in mind. It also 
      shows how students can be creative when using PowerPoint to support their 
      learning of English.</p>
    <p>I have a group of 15 students, each one aged about 14 to 15, who will work 
      with me on this. I also plan to use the other half of my class (the other 
      15) to work with Gao Zhenhuan, if he and his team are willing to collaborate.</p>
    <p>My students, 30 in all, as part of their once a week ICT lessons, will 
      develop some famous English stories for children, using simple English sentences.</p>
    <p>We will create these in PowerPoint, using about ten slides for each story 
      - probably up to 15 stories for you in all. Each slide will be illustrated. 
      As an option, and if your server will cope, we then have the opportunity 
      of sending you some of these stories with animations, as I showed you in 
      Beijing. This aspect will depend on how your server copes with big files, 
      as these would each have about 30 pages, and might crash your system&#8230;. 
      The project will work well without the animations, however.</p>
    <p>We will send these stories to you, and leave space, on each slide, for 
      your college students to add accurate Mandarin translations of the sentences, 
      so each slide has a picture, a sentence in English, (London classroom students) 
      and the same sentence in Chinese (Beijing college students. You then post 
      these collaborations on special new web pages made by your ICT team, for 
      your college students to read and enjoy, in two languages. We will then 
      make links from MirandaNet to your new web pages, so that teachers in the 
      UK can see how this first collaboration has worked.</p>
    <p>The reason for splitting my class into two is simply to make life easier 
      all round. Imaging having 30 stories arriving at the same time, for translation!</p>
    <p>How does this sound to you? It should work easily, without too much stress!</p>
    <p>Susan is planning to work with Beijing school No 27 on Enterprise and other 
      topics, and I was pleased to meet Zhang Dianhua from No. 50, to discuss 
      working on Science Through Arts.</p>
    <p>So it was a very good meeting indeed, and we hope to develop many new projects 
      with you over the coming year.</p>
    <p>Thank you once again for your kindness and support.</p>
    <p>With best wishes to you all,</p>
    <p><em>Lawrence and Susan</em></p>
    <h4>Getting the details correct</h4>
    <p><em>Dear Lawrence and Susan</em></p>
    <p>Thank you for your efficient work, wonderful ideas, and excellent project 
      collaborating between London and Beijing both schools.</p>
    <p> Firstly, there are some mistake in the text recorded our first meeting 
      in Beijing. I am a researcher working in Beijing Academy of Educational 
      Sciences. My assistant Miss Gong Xue, is a student from Beijing Normal (Teacher 
      Training) University. Actually the Beijing group consisted of teachers who 
      are from 11 primary schools and 6 secondary schools and the researchers 
      who are from BAES.</p>
    <p>Secondarily, it is my pleasure that the Specialist Schools and Academies 
      Trust is very interested in our developing collaboration. I agree to you 
      editing our some email correspondence. As a case study I would like to share 
      the experience of developing our collaboration and I would like to record 
      how we have set up our collaboration. Would you like to email me the text 
      edited from our emails? I thought I could learn a lot from your working.</p>
    <p>Thirdly, today I had a meeting with the head teachers, who are from 17 
      projected schools in Beijing, discussing the details of working on the project 
      and how to use ICT to support the collaboration between Beijing and London. 
      They are very interested in your ideas, write or rewrite the stories, create 
      these in PowerPoint, add their own creative ideas and pictures to illustrate 
      the stories. We are looking forward to doing as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>I think it is really an interesting project for both, not only for lots 
      of students but also for lot of teachers.</p>
    <p>Finally, I would like to introduce Professor Zhang Tie Dao to you, who 
      is my leader and he is also Christina Preston&#8217;s friend. Professor 
      Zhang is good at international collaborations in education and his English 
      is excellent.</p>
    <p>Best wishes,</p>
    <p><em>Wang Wei</em></p>
    <p><em>Dear Wang Wei,</em></p>
    <p>Thank you for the further details of the group. This is helpful.</p>
    <p>I shall look through our emails and select the key moments when our ideas 
      were developed, and of course, will continue to develop, as time goes by.</p>
    <p>I am truly delighted to learn that so many teachers in China are interested 
      in the collaboration, and suggest the following:</p>
    <p>The easiest way for us, as a single school, to work with many different 
      schools in China, is for us simply to send the texts to more than one school 
      or college. In this way, your students could add their own illustrations 
      to the PowerPoint files from within a number of different schools. Your 
      web site could have many different sets of illustrations. Perhaps, with 
      so many participants, you might want a small competition to see which files 
      are the best: the most artistic or most creative. Otherwise you might have 
      HUNDREDS of stories to post on the web, and this would be difficult.</p>
    <p>Finally, I shall be delighted to work on-line with Professor Zhang Tie 
      Dao.</p>
    <p>Perhaps he could monitor the project for us, with a view to publishing 
      an academic evaluation at the end?</p>
    <p>Thank you for your continued enthusiasm and kind help.</p>
    <p>Best wishes,</p>
    <p><em>Lawrence</em></p>
    <p><em>Dear Lawrence and Susan</em></p>
    <p>It is my pleasure to meet you and thanks for your e-mail. They are wonderful 
      ideas for collaboration. I had forwarded your e-mail to Mr. Zhang Dianhua 
      and his colleagues. I thought they will responses to your project. Thank 
      you for your ideas. We are looking forward to getting your stories, I thought 
      the project will work better without the animations, as I am afraid our 
      email box is not big enough.</p>
    <p>Regards,</p>
    <p><em>Wang Wei</em></p>
    <p> <em>Dear Wang Wei,</em></p>
    <p>I am sorry that I have not made my ideas clear.</p>
    <p>My idea is not for Mr. Dianhua to work on this, but rather your own teacher 
      trainers and/or trainees! (I am already developing a plan for science education 
      with him.)</p>
    <p>My idea is that we send YOU some simple stories, your teacher-trainees 
      translate them into good Mandarin, with the help of their tutors, and then 
      you post them on your BAES web site, as examples of collaboration between 
      UK students, and Chinese teacher-trainers and their students.</p>
    <p>In this way, the English will be perfect (I will check this) and the Mandarin 
      will also be perfect (You will check that.)</p>
    <p>Then you will have a useful language and cultural resource to show your 
      NEXT group of trainee teachers. They could even look at your web site before 
      they started college!</p>
    <p>As part of this, you might, later on, send US some ideas about a FEW of 
      the Mandarin characters, so that we can learn a little about your language, 
      and how the pictograms and ideograms have been developed.</p>
    <p>It could be an interesting project for both lots of students.</p>
    <p>Please let me know if this is possible for your staff and/or students at 
      BAES.</p>
    <p>Best wishes,</p>
    <p><em>Lawrence</em></p>
    <p><em>Dear Wang Wei,</em></p>
    <p>I have just had a meeting with a colleague at the Specialist schools and 
      Academies Trust, who is very interested in our developing collaboration, 
      and has asked to do the following:</p>
    <p>It would be helpful to UK schools (and to Chinese schools, too) to have 
      a record of how we have set up our collaboration, through MirandaNet, by 
      email, and face to face.</p>
    <p>I need your kind permission to use some parts (carefully chosen and edited) 
      of our email correspondence, to show how ideas grow and develop. I promise 
      to be sensitive about this, and that it will bring you only praise, not 
      difficulty.</p>
    <p>Please let me know if you are willing to allow this. It would be another 
      useful aspect to our work together.</p>
    <p>Best wishes,</p>
    <p><em>Lawrence</em></p>
    <p> <em><strong>As the answer was &#8220;Yes&#8221;, you are able to read 
      this correspondence!</strong></em></p>
    <h4>And so, on to sending the first PowerPoint story, without pictures:</h4>
    <p><em>Dear Wang Wei</em>,</p>
    <p>Please find attached a PowerPoint with some simple text, telling a story 
      for a young child. This is part of our National Curriculum requirements 
      both for English, and for ICT. We ask our students to consider:</p>
    <p>Form: (PowerPoint narrative)<br>
      Purpose: (to entertain) and<br>
      Audience: (younger children)</p>
    <p>The plan is that you send this PowerPoint to someone to translate into 
      Mandarin and add the characters into the PowerPoint. Katie, has indicated 
      where the Mandarin text should go. This is so that the illustrations that 
      she has now started to create will still be seen easily on the page.</p>
    <p>Can you kindly send this on to whoever can translate it, and return it, 
      please.</p>
    <p>If the system works, I have 6 more to send immediately, and still more 
      to send next week.</p>
    <p>There are 30 students in our group.</p>
    <p>Then, later perhaps, our students could communicate directly with their 
      partners in Beijing</p>
    <p>And your students could also illustrate the stories, for comparison with 
      ours.</p>
    <p>Best wishes,</p>
    <p><em>Lawrence, and the Year 9 girls at Holy Cross</em></p>
    <p> <em>Dear Lawrence</em></p>
    <p>Thank you for your story.</p>
    <p>On Monday, I will send this PowerPoint to my projected schools and then 
      translate it into Mandarin and add the characters into the PowerPoint.</p>
    <p>No problem.</p>
    <p>Best wishes,</p>
    <p><em>Wang Wei</em></p>
