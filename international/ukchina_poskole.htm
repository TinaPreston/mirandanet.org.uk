    <h3>Poskole 2007    International ICT Conference</h3>
    <p>April 25th to 27th 2007<br>
      Lazne Sedmihorky, Czech Republic</p>
    <p><strong>Report</strong></p>
    <p>Poskole is now the leading ICT conference for teachers, teacher trainers,
      and academics in Eastern Europe. Organised this year by Dr. Mirka Cernochova,
      (below, far right) from the Charles University, in Prague and by Professor
      Ivan Kalas, from the Comenius University, Bratislava, it celebrated its
      15th anniversary this April with the widest and highest quality of academic
      papers and workshops ever presented. Below are some of the Poskole 2007
      team, with international visitors from the UK, including Hanse P&otilde;ldoji
      from Estonia (in black.) See: <a href="http://poskole.org/2007">http://poskole.org/2007</a> </p>
  <p class="centeredImage"><img src="ukchina/Poskole_Team_Small.jpeg" alt="The Poskole Team (Susan and Lawrence Williams in the centre)" title="The Poskole Team (Susan and Lawrence Williams in the centre)" width="640" height="479"><br>
The Poskole Team (Susan and Lawrence Williams fourth and third from the right)</p>
    <p>MirandaNet was represented at the conference by Susan and Lawrence Williams,
      (centre) who jointly gave the Keynote presentation on the international
      day, Friday 27th April. The subject, which was very warmly received, was
      the new UK-China collaboration between the two MirandaNet schools, Raynes
      Park High and Holy Cross, both London comprehensives, working with Chinese
      schools and colleges in Beijing.</p>
    <p>Susan began the proceedings with an account of the latest UK government
      initiative for schools: Enterprise. She explained how schools were being
      challenged to create new curriculum resources and lesson plans, in order
      to deliver new skills which would support their understanding of business
      and enterprise concepts. Susan then explained how she was able to deliver
      this through her English lessons at Raynes Park. As part of her presentation,
      she showed the web pages on MirandaNet which document some teacher training
      aspects of this project. (See the section on <a href="ukchina_training.htm">Teacher
      Training</a>.)</p>
    <p>She also showed an example of PowerPoint work about Enterprise, by one
      of her own Year 8 students, (below left) which had been sent, with English
      voice-over, to Beijing School Number 27. </p>
    <p>In return, Beijing School Number 27 sent similar PowerPoint presentations
      (right) about their own school to London, for comparison. Instantaneous
      conference translation into Czech was ably carried out, as usual, by David
      Ulbrich, (far right), now an old friend.</p>
    <p class="centeredImage"><img src="ukchina/Susan_RHPS.jpeg" alt="Susan and Raynes Park High School" title="Susan and Raynes Park High School" width="640" height="479"><br>Susan and Raynes Park High School</p>
  <p class="centeredImage"><img src="ukchina/Susan_ppt_no27.jpeg" alt="Susan and School No 27" title="Susan and School No 27" width="640" height="479"><br>Susan and School No 27</p>
    <p>The next step for these two collaborating schools will be to widen the
      project to include bi-lingual work on some further aspect of Business Studies
      and Enterprise.</p>
    <p>      This Keynote introduction was followed by Lawrence&#8217;s own presentation,
      which outlined the new UK-China collaboration between the two London schools
      and the Beijing Academy of Educational Sciences (BAES). On screen is the
      stunning &#8220;logo&#8221; for the Learning-Together web site in Beijing.
      Apart from the BAES web site, these lovely lions, (from Trafalgar Square
      and the Emperor&#8217;s Summer Palace), now grace many web pages on MirandaNet,
      on the Holy Cross School site, and on the Specialist Schools and Academies&#8217; Trust
      web sites.</p>
  <p class="centeredImage"><img src="ukchina/Lawrence_Susan_and_Lions_Small.jpeg" alt="Lawrence and Susan and  the Lions" title="Lawrence and Susan and  the Lions" width="640" height="479"><br>Lawrence and Susan and  the Lions</p>
    <p>(See the section on <a href="../publications/why_china.htm">Why and how</a>)</p>
    <p>BAES is
        developing a stunning new website to support this collaboration. (See:
        <a href="http://www.learning-together.net/">www.learning-together.net</a> where you will find the students&#8217; learning
        outcomes of the projects.)</p>
    <p>Lawrence (a Poskole committee member) then explained the new on-line UK-China
      community that he is creating, as outlined below.</p>
    <p>To summarise, broadly:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Holy Cross provides the creative driving-force of the projects</li>
	  <li>BAES carries
      the learning outcomes, in English and in Mandarin</li>
	  <li>MirandaNet carries the
      history and pedagogy of the projects</li>
	  <li>The Specialist Schools and Academies&#8217; Trust
        publicises the projects as good ICT practice across the UK</li>
	  <li>iNet has encouraged
	      the project through presentations at national level (2007)</li>
	  <li>The British
	      Council has sent delegations to Holy Cross to see our work, and this
	    has allowed us to develop further
          links with Taiwan province
            (2006)</li>
	</ul>
    <p>These sites are hyperlinked to provide an on-line community of teachers
      and teacher trainers, giving easy access to the UK-London Learning Together
      Project from many different starting points, both in the UK and in China.</p>
    <p>Finally, the &#8220;<a href="../star/index.html">Science Through Arts</a>&#8221; Project, (<a href="../star/index.html">STAR</a>) whose
      web site was decommissioned by NASA in January 2007, following draconian
      Federal budget cuts, has been reborn in Taiwan province.</p>
    <p class="centeredImage"><img src="ukchina/Lawrence_and_Taiwan_Small.jpeg" alt="Lawrence and Taiwan" title="Lawrence and Taiwan" width="640" height="479"><br>Lawrence and Taiwan</p>
    <p>Taichung First Senior High School has energetically adopted STAR by creating
      a new on-line resource, in collaboration with Holy Cross. See: <a href="http://web.tcfsh.tc.edu.tw/england/index.html">web.tcfsh.tc.edu.tw/england</a>      This
      new initiative resulted from the visit to Holy Cross by a ministerial-level
      delegation, hosted by the British Council, in December 2006. The revised
      Holy Cross/ NASA/ Taichung/ STAR project also formed part of Lawrence&#8217;s
      presentation. </p>
    <p>On the screen above is the MirandaNet report on Taichung FSHS&#8217;s
      excellent work, with a live link from MirandaNet to the new Taiwan STAR
      web site. This is a rapidly developing collaboration between MirandaNet,
      Holy Cross and a very fine Taiwanese secondary school. A range of new Holy
      Cross/Taichung FSHS projects is currently under development, and will no
      doubt be shared with Poskole delegates in the future.</p>
    <p>All in all, Poskole 2007 was a very successful conference.</p>
    <p>      Conference data, supplied by Dr Mirka Cernochova, Pedagogical Faculty,
        the Charles University in Prague</p>
    <p>      The POSKOLE Conference has accreditation by the Ministry of Education,
        as a part of 
      training courses for teachers&#8217; professional development. It is not
      only the 
      National Conference: it is more than a conference, with a wide range of
      practical Workshops. It offers the opportunity for teachers to learn from
      others, to contribute, to share their ideas and knowledge with others.
      Each active participant obtains a certificate for their participation in
      a workshop, for lecturing, for leading a workshop, or for the presentation
    of an academic paper. </p>
    <p>The POSKOLE 2007 Conference has been newly organised to share ideas and
      experiences, and to support an active approach for participants. We decided
      to organise POSKOLE as morning paper presentations, and afternoon workshops,
      in 4 computer rooms. </p>
    <p><strong>Participants</strong>: </p>
    <p>93 participants from Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, United Kingdom,
      Estonia and Australia </p>
    <p><strong>Papers</strong>: </p>
    <p>The papers were prepared by their authors and were of a high quality.
      We divided 
      them in the Proceedings into these sections: </p>
    <ol>
	  <li>Research in Information Education </li>
	  <li>Informatics, robotics </li>
      <li> Projects in schools </li>
      <li> SW applications </li>
      <li> WWW sources</li>
      <li>ICT in school subjects</li>
      <li>E-learning in education</li>
      <li>Teacher education</li>
    </ol>
	
      <p><strong>Workshops</strong>: </p>
    <p>All the workshops were prepared by teachers from Primary or Secondary
      schools 
    and by the university teachers. The workshops were dedicated to: </p>
    <ol>
	  <li>ICT in curriculum of Czech schools, ICT in teacher profession,</li>
	  <li> skill development in using SW applications (video production, CABRI
        3D, <br>
      Cinema 4D, Macromedia Flash, etc.)</li>
      <li>e-learning platforms and learning
        objects repository (Moodle, CALIBRATE,</li>
      <li>pedagogical mastery (how to
        design good tests)</li>
      <li>methodology of programming (Imagine, Design Patterns
        First,</li>
      <li>remote laboratory in school practice</li>
      <li>ICT in language education (Czech,
        English) - one was managed by James Thomas from Australia - Using the
        British National Corpus when correcting students&#8217; English</li>
      <li>pedagogical and methodological mastery (concept
        maps)</li>
      <li>applications of computers in experiments in Physics, Chemistry
        (ISES, Coach),</li>
      <li>Web 2.0 in education </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The teachers prepared 33 workshops - it was very difficult to put 
      all in the programme: we finally chose 28. All of them were very interesting. </p>
