    Curriculum Exchange </h3>
  <p>International news travels fast in China thanks to the Internet. Access is 
    not confined to the main cities either. Four hours coach drive away from Hangzhou, 
    the regional capital, I logged on in a busy 24 hour Internet caf&eacute; in 
    the small town of Lishu. I had been invited to Lishu by Rainbow Leaping King 
    to meet her family over a banquet of fried cicadas and lily roots. Rainbow's 
    uncle had carefully prepared a speech in English which began, &quot;Please 
    ask Mr. Blair to stop the Americans from bombing Iraq.&quot; World peace was 
    a frequent theme of conversation with Chinese people who are as anxious as 
    we are about world events.</p>
  <p>China is still a very poor country. The Chinese see education as a route 
    to prosperity. Now that urban families have only one child each, no expense 
    is too great for &quot;the little emperor&quot;. Some parents pay about &pound;1,000, 
    a huge sum in China, to give their child a year's head-start in a private 
    kindergarten.</p>
  <p>But Chinese calligraphy presents a major learning hurdle. Over 2,000 individual 
    characters must be learnt by heart in order to read and write adequately. 
    There are no short cuts. Meanwhile English is soon to be adopted as the second 
    language. Indeed more Chinese are learning English than speak English in the 
    rest of the world. The Internet has spurred their interest as well since this 
    is an inexhaustible fund of world information.</p>
  <p>The Chinese are not only learning English, but embracing active styles of 
    learning from the West. Confucianist styles of teaching, like respect for 
    hierarchical relationships, the concepts of face and self-effacement and passivity 
    in class are giving way to Western approaches. For example, British students 
    tend to ask questions 'as a way of learning' whereas Chinese students ask 
    questions 'after learning'. Asking questions in China reflects badly on the 
    teacher because asking questions suggests that the teacher did not teach well 
    enough in the first place. This habit is hard to break but in experimental 
    schools pupils are now being encouraged to question the teacher. On the other 
    hand UK students have much to learn from Chinese students about their discipline 
    and enthusiasm for learning.</p>
  <p>Most classes have sixty students and computers are seen as a route to active 
    learning. Linux is the preferred operating system for the networks. Data projectors 
    linked to computers are common in classrooms. In one Beijing school I visited 
    parents pay as much as &pound;180 a year for access to an educational intranet 
    with educational resources run by a local company - again a huge sum.</p>
  <p>Exchanges between UK and Chinese teachers are being planned on the theme 
    of international citizenship. Last August in Beijing Chris Warren, Actis, 
    and I ran the first active workshop in this exchange. We were working with 
    Chinese teachers seconded to educational software action research projects 
    with the Beijing Academy of Educational Sciences (BAES). To start with an 
    investigation of citizenship digital resources helped us all to identify the 
    differences between the Chinese and the UK definition of citizenship. </p>
  <p>A whole day was devoted to a computer based activity written by Chris Warren 
    focusing on a bicycle crash - a good subject for China. The teachers had to 
    work out how the crash had happened and who was responsible by collaboration 
    and co-operation. The computer provided various kinds of data and printouts 
    to be investigated. We were prepared for reticence, but we found instead that 
    the teachers who were keen to participate found the twists and turns in the 
    plot exciting. It was a good time to remind the Chinese that it was Confucius 
    who said, &quot;I hear and I forget; I see and I remember; I do and I understand.&quot; 
    Flood Alert! is the next computer activity to be planned. </p>
  <p>In January Chinese teachers will be visiting Chafford Hundred Campus in Essex, 
    Cheam School in Berkshire, Blue Gate Field School in East London's Domex region 
    and Waldegrave Girls' School in Twickenham to set up Citizenship projects 
    on the Internet. Ten UK teachers funded by the British Council will be visiting 
    Beijing to develop citizenship projects in May (see the <a href="mulan.htm">Mulan 
    Web Page</a> for more information).</p>
  <p>All the Chinese teachers in the current project speak good English but we 
    are experimenting with a website in two languages so that more Chinese can 
    get involved. The power of the Internet is to give life and shape to communication 
    between visits which is vital for success. </p>
  <p>Zhang Tiedo, the Director of the BAES, is keen to see citizenship Internet 
    projects developed between UK and Chinese schools as a strategy for breaking 
    down cultural barriers and increasing global understanding. Perhaps this is 
    a small step towards world peace between great nations.</p>
