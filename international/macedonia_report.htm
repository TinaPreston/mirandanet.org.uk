  <h3>Visit to Skopje and Bitola, Macedonia April 2006</h3>
  <p><strong>MirandaNet Report by Susan Williams, MA, Dip Ed.</strong></p>

  <h3>B<a name="background"></a>ackground</h3>
  <p> The invitation to work in Macedonia followed the visit to the United Kingdom 
    of a number of educators from the pedagogical faculties of Skopje and Bitola 
    Universities, where primary school teachers are trained. In November 2005, 
    MirandaNet Fellow, Lawrence Williams, had presented his London school&#8217;s 
    use of ICT tools for cross-curricular education, and this work generated much 
    interest. Accordingly, a series of emails was sent to London, inviting the 
    further sharing of ideas for using ICT across the school curriculum. These 
    invitations were warmly accepted by Lawrence and me.</p>
  <h3>I<a name="skopje"></a>n Skopje</h3>
  <p> <a href="macedonia_gallery.htm#susan"><img src="macedonia_images/lecture_susan.jpg" alt="Susan addressing the Pedagogical Faculty" width="200" height="132" class="imageRight"></a>Lawrence 
    and I had accepted the invitation of Lence Miloseva to visit the pedagogical 
    faculty of St. Kliment Ohridski, a teacher training faculty in the Macedonian 
    capital, Skopje. This faculty specialises in kindergarten and primary education, 
    over a four year course. Anita and Yuri were very generous with their time, 
    and set out to give us a true feel of their work. The Dean, Dr Murat Murati, 
    a specialist in Macedonian botany, graciously welcomed us with strong Macedonian 
    coffee, and expressed the hope that links with MirandaNet, and participation 
    in the STAR project, could be established. Lawrence explained that Francis 
    Howlett was already working on a web presence for Macedonian teachers on the 
    London server, and that they would be very welcome to become a new Chapter 
    in the global MirandaNet community.</p>
  <p>It was reminiscent of our experience of MirandaNet&#8217;s work, in South 
    Africa, that teaching at the faculty was undertaken in several different languages. 
    Professors chose to concentrate on Macedonian, Albanian or Turkish, as these 
    languages are all variously spoken by teachers and students. Graduate students 
    would spend their working lives in schools using one or more of these languages. 
    They claimed that 90% of kindergarten and primary student teachers were trained 
    at St. Kliment Ohridski.</p>
  <p>A new subject-specific ICT room was under construction and, with the guidance 
    of Anita and Yuri, all the screens faced the same way so that lecturer could 
    easily see every screen.</p>
  <p><a href="macedonia_gallery.htm#poster"><img src="macedonia_images/art_poster.jpg" alt="Art Poster on Harmony" width="200" height="97" class="imageRight"></a>Lawrence 
    and I also visited other departments. In the Art Department, where the emphasis 
    was on giving students the language of art, the Head of Department, Mr. Rashat 
    Ahmenti explained that his students used ICT for their Dissertations, and 
    Lawrence recommended &#8220;PhotoShop&#8221; as a useful program in developing 
    aspects of creative art work, as he would be showing in his lecture, later 
    in the week. In perfect English, Mr. Ahmenti explained his belief that Art 
    shared a common cultural heritage. He explained that Nature moves in circles, 
    but only a trained mind would be able to draw straight lines, and right-angles. 
    In an unwitting foretaste of the STAR presentation, and obviously in tune 
    with its purpose, he explained that this is why NASA scientists looked for 
    straight lines and right-angles on Mars, as one clear indication of intelligent 
    life. It was also interesting to see the students&#8217; completed work in 
    mask and puppet making. Puppetry is an important element in Macedonian early 
    education, enabling children to develop language skills, and to strengthen 
    ethical concepts.</p>
  <p><a href="macedonia_gallery.htm#outside"><img src="macedonia_images/outside_the_faculty.jpg" width="200" height="279" class="imageRight"></a>Ljupco 
    Sokolov, the Head of Music and an accomplished viola player, split his teaching 
    time between the Music Conservatoire and St. Kliment Ohridski, where he taught 
    keyboarding skills and essential musical notation. The electronic keyboards 
    were coupled up to a local area network. </p>
  <p>Anita, who kindly took time out from her teaching commitment to talk with 
    us, is currently working on her Master&#8217;s degree, with the subject of 
    ICT in the Primary Curriculum. She is keen to emphasise incorporating ICT 
    into subject areas, as well as teaching it as a subject. I explained how MirandaNet 
    Fellows have encouraged this development, and that the MirandaNet web site 
    provided access to a range of support materials. </p>
  <h3>I<a name="bitola"></a>n Bitola</h3>
  <p> We travelled in the local coach to Bitola on a four-hour journey. I gave 
    my first presentation on behalf of MirandaNet, while Lawrence gave two presentations 
    and led a MirandaNet Workshop. I concentrated on my own use of ICT in the 
    classroom, as a Business Studies, English, and Special Needs teacher. (This 
    year I am not teaching RE!). I structured the talk starting with how I use 
    one computer, and led up to my use of the school network. We had been told 
    on arrival that the audience would be made up of students and practising teachers 
    of primary education, but I was easily able to link in my images of Sake manufacturing 
    in my PowerPoint presentation. These images came about through a visit to 
    the Japanese Emperor&#8217;s Sake factory, in Kyoto, Japan, kindly arranged 
    by Madoka, the wife of Japan&#8217;s MirandaNet Fellow, professor Hiro Tanaka. 
    I suggested that similarly scanned photographs, in a picture book, could be 
    shared with a class at &#8220;story time&#8221;. The Professor with responsibility 
    for primary reading complimented me on my logical presentation, and I was 
    pleased that this lecture was seen to follow the high standards of MirandaNet.</p>
  <p>At coffee time, we welcomed the opportunity to share ideas with the lecturers 
    of the University of Bitola, including the Vice Dean, Professor Zlatko Zoglev. 
    We stressed that MirandaNet provided an on-line forum for solving problems, 
    and also for sharing good practice. This information was enthusiastically 
    received by these pioneers in Macedonian ICT teaching. We were then welcomed 
    by the Dean, Dr Simeon Siljanovski, who graciously invited us to dine with 
    him that night. We were also pleased to have the opportunity to meet other 
    teachers in the faculty over more cups of bracing Macedonian coffee.</p>
  <p>During the morning of Wednesday 12th April, Lawrence was interviewed by both 
    the National and a local cable television station. The two channels interviewed 
    him separately, so that two sets of viewers now know first hand about MirandaNet, 
    and secondly about the STAR Project. While this added to an already busy day, 
    it nonetheless served and supported the purpose of our visit. </p>
  <p>Lawrence&#8217;s talk was on the development of cross-curricular ICT use, 
    from the Light Project through to his current work on the STAR Project. As 
    all the published papers referring to his projects are also documented on 
    the MirandaNet site, he concentrated on outlining them briefly, and referred 
    participants to MirandaNet to study them in detail. His examples of school 
    work were limited to his Year 7 and 8 pupils (ages 11 to 13) in order to match 
    the needs of the audience, where primary education finishes at age 14.</p>
  <p>The Dean at Bitola University, Professor Simeon Siljanovski, had kindly arranged 
    that Dr Tatjana Atanasoska and Assistant Professor Daniela Andonovska-Trajkovska 
    could rearrange their teaching commitments, which start at 7.30 a.m. and continue 
    into the small hours, with the marking of their end of semester projects. 
    Macedonia follows Christian Orthodox religious holidays so their Easter this 
    year was the following weekend from ours in the UK. They worked on our Good 
    Friday. This continuity of translation, and support, their attention to detail, 
    and unfailing kindness were much appreciated by us both.</p>
  <p><a href="macedonia_gallery.htm#peering"><img src="macedonia_images/Susan_peering.jpg" alt="Susan peering" width="200" height="149" class="imageRight" title="Susan peering"></a>The 
    afternoon was spent watching Macedonian ICT in action, in Elpida Kazamandi, 
    a school named after a national heroine of World War II. We thought that MirandaNet 
    Kazamandi had a pleasant ring to it, but acknowledge that the new leaders 
    of the MirandaNet Chapter in the country must make their own decision about 
    a name. The teachers in Elpida Kazamandi are enthusiastic in their wish to 
    showcase their pupils&#8217; work on MirandaNet. We were privileged to be 
    invited to view classes in three different subject areas, by three different 
    specialists. The class sizes averaged 30 using 15 new computers. These computers 
    and those in other Macedonian schools had been donated by the Chinese Government.</p>
  <p>The first class linked poetry, biology and art, when nine-year-old pupils 
    followed a presentation prepared by one of the class (and her older brother) 
    on the characteristics of butterflies. This was followed by a poem about butterfly 
    flight. The pupils finished the session using the &#8220;Draw&#8221; package 
    to create their version of a butterfly. We have asked for a lesson plan by 
    Gordana Ugrinovska of this lesson, for display on Mirandanet.</p>
  <p><a href="macedonia_gallery.htm#suite"><img src="macedonia_images/geography.jpg" alt="Geography Lesson" width="200" height="149" class="imageRight" title="Geography Lesson"></a>The 
    Geography lesson had older pupils re-ordering a delivered text, illustrating 
    it with their choice of internet pictures, and completing the task with additional 
    information on agricultural and animal farming in Macedonia.</p>
  <p>The final class was learning the Macedonian language, and was a grammar lesson. 
    The introduction saw the trainee student teacher using the main computer screen 
    to remind pupils of parts of speech. Working in pairs, the pupils described 
    illustrations in complex sentences. Again, Macedonian hospitality was warm, 
    and we appreciated the opportunity to share information informally over more 
    coffee and biscuits.</p>
  <p>The evening meal with the Dean, and English lecturer Maja Stela, was a sampling 
    of traditional dishes and wine, accompanied by live Macedonian folk music. 
    The Dean is an internationally renowned artist, whose work ranges from abstract 
    painting to icons. Much of his work has been sold to America. Maja Stela, 
    the lecturer with responsibility for students who will be teaching English, 
    is a published poet, and kindly gave us books of her poems. She splits her 
    work between a school and the University, and in her spare time enjoys creating 
    miniature sculptures, viewing them through a magnifying glass. The excellent 
    company, attractive surroundings, and delicious food enhanced our conversation 
    about the future for MirandaNet in Macedonia and possible student involvement 
    in the <a href="../star/index.html">NASA STAR</a> project.</p>
  <p>Lawrence&#8217;s final presentation, on Thursday morning, concentrated specifically 
    on the <a href="../star/index.html">STAR</a> project, emphasising that it could be undertaken 
    by the two schools in Macedonia which already had internet cameras. Our later 
    Workshop in the ICT lab enabled the practising teachers to log onto MirandaNet 
    and explore the menu and links to various sites, including STAR. </p>
  <p><a href="macedonia_gallery.htm#group"><img src="macedonia_images/group.jpg" alt="The Group" width="200" height="69" class="imageRight" title="The Group"></a>As 
    a result of this Workshop, Daniela Andonovska-Trajkovska was acknowledged 
    as Macedonia&#8217;s MirandaNet link person, with support from Tatjana, her 
    Head of Department. Josef, a student, was to become the co-opted and paid 
    technician to establish a web site in the Macedonian language, and a governing 
    lead team was formed as a necessary support to Daniela. Papers written in 
    English would be sent by Daniela to Lawrence, who would forward them to MirandaNet 
    for publication on the London site.</p>
  <p>The lunch hour gave us the chance to meet the students specialising in English, 
    who had been timetabled in other areas and had missed our presentations. It 
    was humbling to confront such a large group who were willing to give us their 
    free time, and exciting to see their interest both in MirandaNet and in STAR.</p>
  <p>The afternoon visit to St. Kliment Ohridski afforded us the opportunity to 
    see two students from the University at different stages of their training, 
    in an observed and graded practice lesson, showing their use of ICT in their 
    own subject area. The school provided a translator, Nikola Avramovski, who 
    furnished us with the information that some teachers had four probationary 
    years before gaining a permanent contract!</p>
  <p>The younger teaching student had prepared a video, presented on the University&#8217;s 
    PC, and loaned for the occasion, showing the tools used for different traditional 
    crafts. The 9 year olds were encouraged to name these tools, and later identify 
    those needed for, say, tailoring or cobbling. The video was extremely well 
    filmed and crafted, and would be a valuable asset to any UK Business Studies 
    or Enterprise lesson.</p>
  <p>The more experienced student teacher delivered a Macedonian language lesson. 
    She had created a PowerPoint presentation with the text of the &#8220;Beauty 
    and the Beast&#8221; story illustrated generously including stills from the 
    Disney cartoon. This she read to the class. Her next PowerPoint presentation 
    offered amusingly illustrated choices, and key stages, of the story. For example, 
    What if Beauty had been ugly? Would she have consulted a plastic surgeon or 
    a magician? Each choice was supported by an entertaining picture. The consequences 
    of the class&#8217;s choices were shown to gales of laughter from the 7 year 
    olds. It was an enchanting experience. It was also, of course, a brilliant 
    practice in thinking skills, and in addition in language acquisition. We were 
    told that the students are creating a bank of traditional folk tales so that, 
    when they finish the course, they have a body of prepared material to share 
    and use.</p>
