    <p><a href="http://www.fit-2-learn.com/">www.fit-2-learn.com</a></p>
    <p>Fit 2 Learn is a community interest company based in Croydon in Greater 
      London.</p>
    <p>Our primary purpose is to improve children’s ability to learn. Watch 
      our <a href="http://www.tedxwarwick.com/talks/talk.php?year=2014&amp;id=6">TEDx</a> 
      lecture.</p>
    <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
    <p>Currently children with learning difficulties are statemented and offered 
      coping strategies. It has not been the custom to identify the underlying 
      physiological causes of the developmental delay and correct them.</p>
    <p>Our view is that the ‘inner workings’ of the children can vary 
      in ways which seem small, and yet these have a major influence on the ability 
      to learn and so educational effectiveness. The business has been developed 
      to train teachers and mentors how to screen children and offer each of them 
      personalised exercises &#8211; which can seem much like games or play &#8211; to strengthen the ‘inner workings’ to work better.</p>
    <p>These differences in ‘inner workings’ relate to small gaps in development. 
      By way of illustration, consider a six year old with a little lack of coordination. 
      If noticed at all, it is often assumed the child will ‘grow out of 
      it’. If this does not happen, then ten years later you may well have an 
      angry and frustrated adolescent who is embarrassed by difficulties such 
      as struggling with left and right, reading maps and coping with mathematics. 
      The exercises we offer each child are designed to overcome the initial small 
      gaps in their own development.</p>

	<p><strong>Effective Learning</strong></p>
    <p>An effective learner needs to be able to have the following skills:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Control the big muscles quite precisely so that the left brain controls 
        the right hand side muscles and the right brain controls the left hand 
        side muscles; and any one limb can be moved without any movement from 
        other limbs.</li>
      <li>Control the fine motor skills &#8211; for example, it is easy to hold 
        and control a pencil properly</li>
      <li>Hear clearly with each ear, with no physical blocks to hearing</li>
      <li>Process the messages sent from the ears to the brain &#8211; for example, 
        when a child hears a teacher speak the child is able to make sense of 
        the message</li>
      <li>See clearly, with two independently working eyes (tested by an optician)</li>
      <li>Process the messages sent from the eyes to the brain &#8211; for example, 
        have the ability to judge distances or see images in three dimensions</li>
      <li>Have all the skills of senses and muscle control working together in 
        harmony.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In an efficient learner, most learning is visual. It follows that to learn 
      easily, it is essential that the all the other muscle systems and senses 
      are integrated in the visual system.</p>
    <p>The whole process of strengthening the ‘inner workings' to 
      ensure they are working well together, and that they are embedded in the 
      visual system, is known as Cognitive Visual Integration Therapy (CVIT).</p>
    <p><strong>Cognitive Visual Integration Therapy</strong></p>
    <p>CVIT has been developed from the research and practice of Else Du Plessis 
      in South Africa and her daughter, Daleen Smith, in the UK. Else and Daleen 
      have evolved their treatment for more than twenty years. In this time hundreds 
      of children and adults have been treated, including some who have suffered 
      a stroke.</p>
    <p>In the UK, Daleen typically treats children with learning difficulties, 
      from dyslexia to global developmental delay. Many of these children have 
      statemented conditions. They usually meet Daleen once a week and on other 
      days do specific exercises. Daleen monitors the children’s progress 
      as they work through the programme which lasts between six months and three 
      years. By the end of the programme, the child’s ‘inner workings’ 
      are operating effectively, well above the expectations of children of a 
      similar age; children become calmer, have higher self-esteem, and make remarkable 
      progress in their learning.</p>
    <p><strong>Fit 2 Learn</strong></p>
    <p>This successful approach is presently limited to the few children that 
      Daleen has time to see. Fit 2 Learn is extending the principles of this 
      therapy into the wider community. We are doing this by developing programmes 
      that can be used in schools and other places such as pupil referral units 
      and prisons. Else and Daleen are providing consultancy for the development 
      of the Fit 2 Learn programmes.</p>
    <p>Lots of information is measured throughout the course of the programmes. 
      This monitors the child’s systems regularly and makes sure that the 
      child progresses along the pattern of ordinary development. This is continuous 
      quality control.</p>
    <p>Fit 2 Learn is at the forefront of developing ways of capturing and recording 
      this data digitally. This data will become accessible as a rich resource 
      for further analysis, without identifying the particular children.</p>
    <p>We are confident that these programmes have the potential to transform 
      educational outcomes. The result will be young adults that are able to make 
      a full contribution to the economic and social well-being of the nation.</p>
