    <p>In the past year, an amazing transformation has taken place within the 
      lives of certain students here at Catmose College. They have become involved 
      with Radiowaves either as part of their elective programme, out of pure 
      interest or through their involvement in the BBC News School Report which 
      we upload onto our Radiowaves station.</p>
    <p><strong>Developing Confidence and Literacy</strong></p>
    <p>As part of their involvement, some have become more confident, released 
      their inhibitions, some have enhanced certain life skills like leadership, 
      team-&shy;-working as well as journalistic and literacy skills. One of our 
      students has developed as a sports journalist and his reports are now being 
      featured on the BBC News School Report webpage, with a reward trip to spend 
      some time in the sports news room at TV Centre. Another student, who is 
      not academic in any way and can be slightly troublesome, has been transformed 
      when putting him behind a camera.</p>
    <p>Radiowaves has helped many of our students overcome shyness through their 
      reporting on different stories. This shyness has now become confidence and 
      pride and has also given them a focus which is then transferred into their 
      other classes. The reporters at our school have embraced the Radiowaves 
      technology with enthusiasm; they go about their reporting tasks with diligence 
      and minimum supervision. They are creative in their approach and have built 
      up quite a following of readers/viewers/listeners, both within the school 
      and beyond.</p>
    <p>The Radiowaves reporters are developing 'life' skills which gives them 
      the confidence that they need for the school community they are in, higher 
      education and the world of work in the future.</p>
    <p><strong>Motivating through Social Media</strong></p>
    <p>Our College has embraced social media and embedded the use of the Radiowaves 
      platform into our curriculum. As a college, we are happy for our students 
      to use this media as it is fully moderated both by college and Radiowaves 
      staff, and we know it is safe for our students to use. Students undertake 
      work and then upload it to their own personal page, which they can personalise. 
      The work can be in varied media and this can include written, audio, video 
      and photographic examples.</p>
    <p>We love the fact that our students can create work that can then be viewed 
      by their peers, our staff, other members of Radiowaves and also any one 
      accessing the World Wide Web. We have a number of reports that have been 
      viewed over 4000 times and this creates a huge sense of achievement to our 
      students.</p>
    <p>Using Radiowaves can be a great motivational tool. I would love to be able 
      to share my sense of joy when I log onto the website sometimes and see the 
      reports that have been created or the interaction that is taking place using 
      the comments system. Here at Catmose, we have a number of SEN students who 
      have signed up for Radiowaves as part of our elective program. In particular, 
      one student has poor communication skills but he is now writing reports 
      on his favourite subject and placing comments onto the work of others. This 
      gives me, and the other staff who work closely with him, huge satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Radiowaves and our multimedia equipment is used in many different ways 
      within college. Some subjects are using Radiowaves to &#8216;display&#8217; 
      their students work to the greater community and others as a way of peer 
      and self assessment.</p>
    <p><strong>Curriculum Feedback</strong></p>
    <p>The head of Sports said, &#8220;Radiowaves has been of great value throughout 
      sport. Team Captains have given verbal match reports and inter-&shy;-school 
      fixtures and events have been reported on by reporters. The use of Radiowaves 
      has helped to raise the profile of Sport at the college and given valuable 
      and deserved recognition to those who have participated.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;The use of Radiowaves in the English curriculum has been a particular 
      help to me as an English teacher because students are able to hear their 
      poetry. If we did this without a resource like sound recording equipment, 
      it would be like doing theory work with no practical. Practical in this 
      context is essential because it helps students understand how they are being 
      persuaded by the use of rhetorical techniques.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;The Humanities Department decided to use some Year 7 History topics 
      to examine how Radiowaves could best be used. One successful venture was 
      the recording of a lesson on the Domesday Book, which was used by other 
      members of the Department for training purposes as well as encouraging students 
      to approach their learning in innovative ways. The Department found that 
      students enjoyed the different learning experience, participated better 
      as learners and were more prepared to assist in and assess each other&#8217;s 
      learning. The use of interviews has also encouraged students to question 
      and promote each other&#8217;s progress. Substantial further use is intended 
      of the Radiowaves facility in the coming terms.&#8221;</p>
    <p>As well as being used by the curricular team, it is also being used during 
      tutorial time and part of our elective (extra curricular) programme. The 
      students are very enthusiastic about the ways that they can use the equipment 
      and the website.</p>
    <p>Quote from an English teacher and form tutor &#8220;Well I can say that 
      Radiowaves has been a useful way to reward tutorial work, to celebrate anniversaries 
      and students. I have found it very encouraging to have staff comment on 
      their poetry published on Radiowaves&#8221;.</p>
    <p><strong>Supported Service</strong></p>
    <p>Using Radiowaves within college is a safe way that all our students can 
      interact with Social Networking and Web 2.0, whilst improving their literacy, 
      writing and communication skills.</p>
    <p>We need a safe, moderated area that our students can upload their work 
      to which is motivational, exciting and provides them with satisfaction of 
      a job well done. The students love it as they are in control (subject to 
      work being approved), the staff love it as the students can work creatively, 
      parents love it as they know that their children are working safe online 
      and our SLT love it because they know that our students are gaining so much 
      from the experience.</p>
    <p>If I have a problem, I have a named person to whom I can go to who will 
      do their best to answer my query. There is also a teacher&#8217;s forum 
      where we can interact with other moderators and gain answers from them or 
      even just share ideas. The students also have the &#8216;Mole&#8217; who 
      is a member of the Radiowaves team who answers the reporter&#8217;s queries.</p>
    <p>Last year, we were asked to speak about our use of Radiowaves at three 
      educational Shows and at two of these, we had Radiowaves staff in attendance. 
      The time and effort that they gave to our students was exceptional, and 
      this was really appreciated from me as a member of college staff.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples of students&#8217; work on Radiowaves</strong></p>
    <p>Our station: <a href="http://www.radiowaves.co.uk/catmosecollege/">www.radiowaves.co.uk/catmosecollege</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.radiowaves.co.uk/story/137648/title/Day4part2BergenBelsenConcentrationCamp">www.radiowaves.co.uk/story/137648/title/Day4part2BergenBelsenConcentrationCamp</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is incredibly moving as the students talk about being in a place like 
      Bergen Belsen. Our students now watch this as part of their history lessons 
      as students are more likely to listen to their peers and their experiences 
      than teachers.</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p>I was asked to arrange for reporters to interview Sir Matthew Pinsent as 
      part of the BBC&#8217;s launch of the Olympic World Dreams school search.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.radiowaves.co.uk/story/219118/title/toptipsfromtheexperts">www.radiowaves.co.uk/story/219118/title/toptipsfromtheexperts</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a result of our reporter Colester writing reports on the Ashes for BBC 
      News School report website, he was invited to BBC TV Centre to see behind 
      the scenes at the BBC Sport website. This report includes the interviews 
      he and DJ Staff did with the BBC staff journalists.</p>
