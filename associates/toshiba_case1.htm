    PORTABLE PC TECHNOLOGY</strong>&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">During the 1998/1999 period, as part of its ‘National Grid for 
    Learning’, the Government committed £100 million towards IT infrastructure 
    and equipment in schools nationally, with similar amounts probably being made 
    available in the year 2000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This 
    money has been used to boost every school’s Information Communication Technology 
    (ICT) ability, enabling them to access the Government’s Internet based National 
    Grid for Learning.&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">Because every school in the country was handed the responsibility 
    of assessing how to invest its IT budget, for the first time ever they had 
    the opportunity to instal technological solutions appropriate to their own 
    particular needs.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The most pressing problem facing many schools was the task 
    of ensuring the money was spent wisely and that both children and teachers 
    benefited from the investment.&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">Dorrington Primary School in Birmingham has a current register 
    count of about 610 pupils plus Nursery provision from 3 years old up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>The school is spread across a large site; comprising one main building 
    and extra classrooms in six external huts or Portakabins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Ken Holmes, IT Co-ordinator at Dorrington Primary School had to ensure 
    that each child in the school had sufficient access to a PC, as well as catering 
    for the needs of his colleagues and the Administration staff also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>A concern was that no area of the school could be cut off from the 
    network, an onerous task considering the six extra classrooms.&nbsp;<o:p> 
    </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">While planning the school’s new PC network, Ken Holmes knew 
    he was up against a familiar problem - traditional computer networks require 
    cabling to link each PC in the chain and in the case of Dorrington Primary 
    School this would have meant digging up the playground in order to lay the 
    cabling in an underground pipe to the six external huts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Not only was the cost of the cabling prohibitive but there was the 
    added problem of the cost of the excavation work needed to install it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>It was while he was casting around for an alternative solution that 
    Ken Holmes was able to enlist the help of two people who were able to offer 
    practical and expert advice and who have since become highly involved in this 
    network project.</p>
  <p> James King, Toshiba PC Division’s sector manager responsible for Education 
    and Harvey Harrison, Networking Solutions Manager at XMA, one of Toshiba’s 
    national education suppliers, met Ken Holmes at a local IT Exhibition and 
    Conference for Birmingham’s schools - BITE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The three together applied lateral thinking to the problem facing Dorrington 
    Primary School and once they had rejected the idea of a traditional PC network, 
    began to seriously consider a wireless LAN option.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>This was to prove to be a highly innovative ICT solution and on this 
    basis Dorrington Primary School successfully applied for ICT funding from 
    its local authority.&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">An official ‘Pathfinder’ Authority, Birmingham is one of four 
    national Councils charged with the task of ensuring the government funding 
    is spent wisely and in ways which other schools can emulate. Dorrington Primary 
    School was one of the first 89 schools in Birmingham to be awarded an ICT 
    National Grid funding grant in order to purchase the new network.&nbsp;<o:p> 
    </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">Although the logistics of the operation at Dorrington Primary 
    School were straightforward they required meticulous planning in order to 
    ensure the system worked, Ken Holmes explains: ‘We decided on an initial purchase 
    of 15 Toshiba 4010 Satellite portable PCs and 18 Toshiba Equium 3000M desktop 
    PCs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each of the Toshiba Satellite 
    portable PCs were fitted with an aerial which interacts with a central wireless 
    network infrastructure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Equiums 
    are included in the network through normal Category 5 cabling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>The wireless local area network (LAN) needs just six access points 
    positioned around the school in order to create a seamless network which is 
    accessible from every classroom without the need for wires, even in the Portakabins 
    outside.’&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">‘In fact the set up has turned out even better than expected. 
    The portables are in constant use around the school and are operated by all 
    year groups, from Reception through to Year 6.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Each year group has an area on the server to store its work which means 
    that data can be loaded onto the portables, stored and then accessed from 
    the classroom computers, if required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>The children’s motivation and concentration levels are high when using 
    the laptops and we have been able to further develop their literacy and numeracy 
    abilities through the medium of IT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>This has proved to be an incredibly flexible situation.’</p>
  <p align="left">However, not only do the Toshiba portable Satellite PCs boost 
    classroom capacity to one PC between two children (a big advantage over the 
    alternative of a class of, say, 28 pupils having to share one or two desktop 
    machines between them) but they are also available for the teachers out of 
    school hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Teachers often 
    take the computers home so that they can prepare work on them, often accessing 
    the Internet for information or suitable worksheets that enhance the curriculum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>This also helps them expand their IT knowledge and get training they 
    might otherwise miss out on, plus, the computers are readily available for 
    use on INSET days.&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">Ken Holmes also feels that there have been significant benefits 
    from involving Toshiba at both the planning and implementation stages of the 
    project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was James King who 
    had already seen the benefits portable computing had brought to other industries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>He was keen to see educational establishments being able to reap the 
    benefits also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His summary of 
    the benefits being:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>‘Portable 
    technology allows pupils maximum exposure to the use of PCs because the computing 
    resource can be easily moved from classroom to classroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Because they are powerful but light (weighing just 3.18kg) they are 
    easily packed up for use on school day trips and other occasions when they 
    study off site.’&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">‘The Toshiba Satellites are easily able to cope with large amounts 
    of data and Dorrington Primary School pupils will be able to download relevant 
    information surrounding an educational visit from the Internet before setting 
    off and then record a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">diary</em> of 
    their day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They can also collect 
    relevant information and input it straight onto the harddisk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Once back in school the work can be printed out or integrated into 
    a presentation package.’&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>

    hardware driving the wireless network at Dorrington Primary School (one of 
    Aironet Inc.’s new BRE500 series of high-speed 11Mbps bridges).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Harvey Harrison at XMA Computer Products was responsible for the design 
    and implementation of the new network, he feels that another area where Dorrington 
    Primary School benefits is in the level of care it receives as a result of 
    its close relationship with its IT providers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Ken Holmes agrees:<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>‘We have found that any small glitches which came up with the 
    initial implementation of the system have been quickly ironed out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Problems are always quickly solved.’</p>

    Primiary School is planning to expand on its current total of portable PCs 
    and Harvey Harrison sees no problems with integrating them into the current 
    system:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>‘Because of the wireless 
    nature of this LAN the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>network 
    can be easily expanded in a simple modular fashion, without any disruptive 
    cabling work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even in the unlikely 
    event that the school moves to another site the whole infrastructure could 
    be moved with it.’&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p style="tab-stops: 36.0pt 72.0pt 108.0pt 144.0pt 180.0pt 216.0pt 252.0pt 288.0pt 324.0pt 360.0pt 396.0pt 432.0pt 468.0pt 504.0pt 540.0pt 576.0pt 612.0pt 648.0pt 684.0pt 720.0pt" align="left">There 
    have been financial benefits too:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>‘This 
    system has been purchased just the once by Dorrington, rather than leased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Because it is able to perform at usual Ethernet speeds it will continually 
    be able to deliver data to the classrooms or administration areas, as necessary.’&nbsp;<o:p> 
    </o:p> </p>
  <p style="tab-stops: 36.0pt 72.0pt 108.0pt 144.0pt 180.0pt 216.0pt 252.0pt 288.0pt 324.0pt 360.0pt 396.0pt 432.0pt 468.0pt 504.0pt 540.0pt 576.0pt 612.0pt 648.0pt 684.0pt 720.0pt" align="left">An 
    excellent testimony to the success of this new network is the number of local 
    Advisors and teachers who visit the school to learn from its innovative ICT 
    solution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even the Government 
    has expressed its support and the Prime Minister himself has said that he 
    would like to visit too, when the opportunity arises.&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
