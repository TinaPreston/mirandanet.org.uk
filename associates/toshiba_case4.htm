normal">HAMILTON COLLEGE STUDENTS GRAB OPPORTUNITY TO BE HOME LOAN<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>WITH TOSHIBA PORTABLE PCS</strong>&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">To achieve official Technology Status a secondary school has 
    to demonstrate commitment to the scheme through substantial, long-term investment 
    in information technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
    outcome of this investment being that pupils and staff benefit in all subjects 
    across the curriculum, educational standards are raised and the local community 
    benefits as the school forges strong links with businesses and organisations 
    and passes its knowledge and experience on to other schools locally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p> 
    </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">Recent Government figures (January 2000) show that 480 secondary 
    schools have risen to the challenge of becoming specialist schools.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Some in languages or sport but the majority having opted for Technology 
    Status.&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">Qualification for the scheme is not automatic; each school must 
    raise £50,000 in sponsorship and prepare a four year development plan with 
    measurable targets in teaching and learning in the specialist subject area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>It must also make provision to involve other schools and the wider 
    community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In return, the Government 
    sets up a capital grant for £100,000 plus an additional £120 per pupil per 
    year.&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">For a school such as Hamilton College, the logistics of such 
    an enterprise are made slightly more demanding due to its locality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Principle, Eddie de Middelaer, is realistic about the challenge facing 
    his school:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>‘Hamilton College 
    is on the outskirts of Leicester and most of the Council estates are located 
    on the outer ring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An estimated 
    65% of the local community is currently looking for work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>However, the exciting thing about this scheme is that it is sustainable, 
    even in our area and it gives our pupils an educational equality they might 
    not otherwise have attained.’&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">Technological investment for Hamilton College has become even 
    more of an issue since it has recently had to absorb two other schools from 
    the area, taking it up to a total of 1,200 pupils.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Backing for the bid has come from Toshiba, ABK and local companies 
    such as ICT Co UK.&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">Eddie de Middelaer continues:<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>‘Our Technology Status bid is scheduled for June 2000 but we 
    more or less hit all the criteria anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Technology already accounts for 10% of the core in our Design Technology 
    and 20% in Science.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Official 
    Technology Status is the next step forward for us and it will ensure considerable 
    investment in the technology we see as key to furthering our ambition to propel 
    Hamilton College where we want it to go educationally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>We will be investing in programs such as CAD/CAM dataloggers for science 
    and maths work and on the hardware side we aim to fully exploit the power 
    and flexibility of laptop computers combined with wireless networking technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Every one of our teachers will have a laptop, which will help tremendously 
    with training and hands on experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>History, English, Drama, Sport, every area of the curriculum will grow 
    as a result, not just IT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
    targets we had already reached were challenging but we want to see further 
    rapid but sustained growth.’&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">In order to encourage closer links with the business community 
    and official organisations, schools are encouraged to secure local funding 
    for their bid. A major plus for schools are the links forged with local businesses 
    as a result.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Hamilton 
    College these links have also led to an exciting development which will see 
    every one of its pupils being able to benefit from portable PC technology 
    and Internet access in both the classroom and their own homes.&nbsp;<o:p> 
    </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">ABK services to education has supplied educational establishments 
    with white goods for over 50 years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Over this time it has grown to become the only company in the UK which 
    can offer schools everything from design, build and refurbishment of existing 
    facilities through to the provision of all items of food technology, textile 
    technology and information and communication technology equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Plus, schools can choose either to buy or rent these items.&nbsp;<o:p> 
    </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">Mike Fitton, Managing Director at ABK is enthusiastic about 
    technology, both as a business tool and an educational aid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>The company supplies Nortel Networks’ wireless networking technology, 
    combined with Toshiba portable PCs to schools all over the UK.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>‘Over the last three years ABK has metamorphosised into a ‘virtual 
    company’ simply making excellent use of the technology we recommend to our 
    clients.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We are heavy users of networked PCs, yet you won’t trip over 
    any wires in our offices.’&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">But perhaps the greatest opportunity Hamilton College’s Technology 
    Status will give its pupils is the Home Loan scheme it plans to operate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>This scheme is the brainchild of ABK and the company hopes to see it 
    become a nation-wide initiative before too long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Pupils and parents rent a Toshiba portable PC on a weekly basis and 
    at a subsidised rate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In this 
    case the Toshiba Satellite 1620 CDS, designed specifically for the education 
    sector.&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">The Satellite 1620 CDS is transferable between school and home 
    and is easily able to access the Internet and school LAN in order to help 
    with homework research, IT training and data storage.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>For the first time ever, Hamilton College’s students will be 
    able to take full advantage of everything the world of IT has to offer education 
    and their parents will be able to improve their computer skills and keep up 
    with their child’s progress too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For 
    a school such as Hamilton College this is an unparalleled opportunity.&nbsp;<o:p> 
    </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">Mike Fitton explains why wireless technology is the way ahead 
    for education:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>‘Think about the 
    layout of most typical schools today - they are spread across large sites, 
    needing, say, three or four portakabins to house extra classes and pupils 
    have to move from room to room for each lesson.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>Portable PCs and wireless LANs are the only truly viable solutions 
    which can give teachers and pupils easy access to a PC, the Internet and the 
    schools own LAN.’&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
  <p align="left">Nortel Networks will supply the wireless LAN through which every 
    portable PC in the school will be linked and this leading global communications 
    company is keen to see educational establishments benefit from such up to 
    date technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The BayStack 
    600 Series wireless LAN which will be installed has been designed with enterprising 
    small/medium sized businesses in mind - a perfect analogy for such a forward 
    thinking school as Hamilton College.&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </p>
