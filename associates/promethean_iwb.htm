  <p><img src="promethean_files/flags.jpg" alt="Flags of the four countries" title="Flags of the four countries" width="200" height="140" align="right">Promethean, 
    leaders in interactive technology, are working with the MirandaNet Fellowship 
    to make a difference to the education of learners.</p>
  <p>These long-term partners are undertaking one of the largest worldwide studies 
    ever, to evaluate the impact of Promethean's interactive whiteboard technology 
    on pupils' achievement and on the transformation of the learning experience 
    in schools.</p>
  <p><strong>Stephen Jury, Chief Executive Officer of Promethean</strong> explains 
    that this project is designed to elicit new information about the power of 
    the boards in raising attainment: 'Pupil accomplishment and performance will 
    be measured at critical points in the schools' syllabus, analysing achievement 
    in classes with interactive whiteboards and those without. It is important 
    that this study is undertaken over a number of years so that a benchmark can 
    be established and considered in the coming years. This is important research, 
    which will evaluate the role of technology and in particular, interactive 
    whiteboards, in the learning environment.'</p>
  <p>MirandaNet Fellowship Researchers are investigating the achievements of a 
    core ACTIV teaching community who building a knowledge base on line for other 
    users. These practitioners, advisers and researchers are becoming teacher 
    researchers by investigating specific links between classroom technology and 
    achievement in their local context in China, Mexico and South Africa over 
    three years. They reflect on their ongoing practice and publish their work 
    for others. This mode of sharing experience is an innovative model for Continuing 
    Professional Development in ICT called Action Research or Practice Based Research. 
    The practitioners are being encouraged in these methods of learning: research 
    indicates that this is the most effective way to ensure that teachers become 
    confident users of ICT and take ownership of the effective deployment technology 
    to enrich the learning process.</p>
  <p>In this method MirandaNet Mentor-Fellows who are already expert Promethean 
    ACTIVboard users in UK classrooms are supporting teachers in this action research 
    study in. Five ACTIVambassadors in each country are working with their UK 
    mentors. There are at least 600 learners involved, as well as universities 
    and government agencies. </p>

  <h4>T<a name="projects"></a>he ACTIVprojects</h4>
  <p><strong>C<a name="china"></a>hina</strong></p>
  <p>Three ACTIVprojects are under way in China: two in Beijing and one in Shandong.</p>
  <p><img src="promethean_files/gerbera.jpg" alt="China project gerbera" width="80" height="80" align="left">The 
    Beijing Academy of Educational Sciences (BAES) is seen as the innovative experimental 
    educational institution funded by the Beijing Municipal Authority which overseas 
    a region as large as Belgium. Results from innovations developed at BAES are 
    fed directly into regional policy and purchasing decisions are based on this 
    new knowledge. The BAES focus is on transforming teaching, learning and attainment 
    in primary schools: an area where MirandaNet Fellows have already been running 
    BAES courses. The Academy have selected thirty people from the Academy staff 
    and pilot primary schools in urban and rural Beijing, who will participate 
    in workshops and training sessions focusing on changing classroom teaching. 
    The research will examine the impact of ACTIVboards on learner motivation, 
    interests and academic performance and relate this to changes in classroom 
    management and teacher praxis. BAES will produce training manuals and resources 
    to support the project, which will integrate well into the Chinese system.</p>
  <p>China is making English the official second language so it is pleasing that 
    the other two educational institutions are exploring the use of ACTIVboards 
    in language teaching. In Beijing Secondary School No. 50, 152 students from 
    three Grade 11 classes (some 30% of the total of Grade 11) will use the ACTIVboards 
    for their English lessons. The researchers will examine the attainment and 
    achievement of those taught English through the medium of ACTIVboards, and 
    the remaining 70% of Grade 11 taught traditionally. The investigation will 
    examine all the language competences.</p>
  <p>Shandong Agricultural University have also chosen to focus on the affordances 
    of ACTIVboards for English language teaching and learning in the first year 
    of graduate training when Improving English is vital for investigating global 
    knowledge &#8211;a process which is now greatly facilitated in China through 
    the Internet, so much of which is in English. The use of multimedia resources 
    with flip charts is seen as a powerful language-teaching tool, with the ability 
    to freeze-frame the video and then annotate the frame. Writing frameworks 
    will also be developed in the flip charts to develop student performance. 
    Students will then progress to the creation of flip charts and resources to 
    support colleagues and pupils in Mexico through collaborative projects on 
    the theme of World Citizenship. Links are planned with the British Council 
    who already make extensive use of ACTIVboards and have a broad knowledge and 
    experience of effective software.</p>

  <p><strong>M<a name="mexico"></a>exico</strong></p>
  <p><img src="promethean_files/cactus.jpg" alt="Mexicao project cactus" width="80" height="80" align="left">This 
    initiative is embedded in the Mexican government strategy to transform learning 
    and teaching in state schools. In this context the Government is using ACTIVboards 
    as major catalyst for change. </p>
  <p>The three Mexican projects are in the Nuevo Leon province, of which Monterrey 
    is the capital: the Antonio Martinez de Castro Primary School, Leopoldo Narranjo 
    Primary School, and Simon Salazar Mora Primary School. All the ACTIVambassadors 
    work in the evening sessions of the schools, and their projects examine different 
    aspects of Citizenship. Because the Monterrey regional government and UNESCO 
    are involved an overarching theme of Citizenship has been chosen which is 
    central to the new curriculum.</p>
  <p>Jesus Gomez is the ACTIVambassador at Antonio Martinez de Castro School. 
    He is using the ACTIVboard in a project that links literacy, storyboarding 
    and Citizenship with improving moral values of pupils who belong to street 
    gangs and often lack positive role models. The ACTIVboard will become a stage 
    on which a variety of narratives can be constructed: comic books, reading 
    campaigns, posters and dramatic productions.</p>
  <p>At Leopoldo Narranjo School the ACTIVproject is on global citizenship themes. 
    Fabiola Araiza Rodriguez is examining the impact of the ACTIVboards on the 
    motivation and attainment of pupils who have no previous experience of IT. 
    The impact of ACTIVboards on teaching and learning the subject of Citizenship 
    in students from a low socioeconomic status will be evaluated, as well as 
    wider issues relating to pupil learning and conceptual change. The project 
    involves 179 pupils.</p>
  <p>The ACTIVproject at Simon Salazar Mora Primary School is led by Yazmin Garza. 
    Her investigation is focused on ways in which the ACTIVboard can contribute 
    to pupil learning in history. As an ACTIVambassador in her school she is keen 
    to change attitudes towards the teaching and learning of History, and use 
    it to consolidate literacy. As she says, &#8220;We study history to know the 
    past, to understand the present and to change the future. In this way, we 
    can change our teaching methods and to develop a global citizenship education.&#8221;</p>

  <p><strong>S<a name="south_africa"></a>outh Africa</strong></p>
  <p><img src="promethean_files/strelitzia.jpg" alt="South Africa project strelitzia" width="80" height="80" align="left">In 
    South Africa this ACTIVproject matches well with the national outcomes based 
    curriculum where the emphasis is on ACTIV learning. The e-Learning Institute, 
    based at Pretoria University, is managing the two schools in the Johannesburg 
    area of Gauteng Province. These two schools are independent schools, which 
    are using the project to ensure effective outreach in to the community and 
    into Township schools. </p>
  <p>At Auckland Park Preparatory School two ACTIVambassadors are working with 
    the whole school, supporting a range of curriculum projects, as well as implementing 
    their own case studies.</p>
  <p>Gail Rossini has just completed a project with a Grade 1 class. One class 
    worked through a reading book in the conventional manner while the other did 
    the same work using the ACTIVboard. Grade Six pupils were involved in gathering 
    evidence of the Grade 1 pupils&#8217; sight word vocabulary, both before and 
    after the lessons. A questionnaire also completed to find whether the comprehension 
    of the two groups differed. Again the Grade Six pupils were involved with 
    the Grade Ones and pupils were tested on a one-to-one basis. The initial results 
    show that those who interacted with the ACTIVboard had better scores. This 
    study will expand its scope during the year.</p>
  <p>The second ACTIVproject at Auckland Part Preparatory School is led by Gill 
    Barnard and involves Grade 6 pupils, whose involvement with the projects has 
    already been mentioned. Their specific work is based on data handling and 
    interpretation of information relating to Conservation. A range of the ACTIVboard 
    tools are used to enable pupils to visualise and transform data.</p>
  <p>The second school, St. Mary&#8217;s, Waverly, is examining the impact of 
    ACTIVboard technology across the curriculum. Jenny Ketley Is the ACTIVambassador 
    within the school, and she has trained and supports most staff. Exciting projects 
    underway combine sound, video and text in the teaching of poetry and plays, 
    images and video for teaching human biology and images of the pupils themselves 
    for hockey coaching. St. Mary&#8217;s is also working with colleagues from 
    a range of local schools in its outreach programme.</p>
  <p>At the forthcoming workshop in Cape Town, July 8 &amp; 9, colleagues will 
    be presenting their work and developing their projects. Links will also be 
    strengthened between the countries in preparation for international projects. 
  </p>
  <p>Another three countries will begin this action research in 2007 and then 
    every two years after that as an ongoing study. The plan is to create a knowledge 
    base online that shares international teachers' ACTIVboard experience and 
    resources in all curriculum areas which will be a great support to potential 
    users as well as celebrating the achievements of expert users.</p>
  <p>Visitors to the MirandaNet website will be able to follow the progress of 
    this ACTIVboard project by following the link to Promethean Ambassadors. Teachers 
    will even be able to advise on best practice in implementing and using this 
    interactive technology. An ACTIV community of users will have an internal 
    online link to exchange ideas, newsletters and invitations; to present at 
    conferences and seminars; as well as opportunities to publish and use the 
    World Ecitizens environment.</p>
