  <p><img src="promethean_files/flags.jpg" alt="Flags of the four countries" title="Flags of the four countries" width="200" height="140" align="right">Practising 
    teachers in China, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom are participating 
    in a three year programme, 2005 2008, conducted by MirandaNet Fellows. The 
    aim is to find out how Promethean ACTIVboards and linked digital tools can 
    assist in raising achievement and in the management of change across four 
    nations. </p>
  <p>The findings aim to provide detailed evidence and advice for educators and 
    policy makers who are charged with improving education in the long term, and 
    for teachers and teacher advisers who need access to creative ideas and advice. 
    The project focuses on the use of interactive whiteboards and other digital 
    tools by 1,000 children and 100 teachers in schools in China, Mexico, South 
    Africa and the United Kingdom. In each of these countries the government is 
    funding the infrastructure needed to embed Information and Communications 
    Technologies into the curriculum. </p>
  <p>The project also supports ten practice-based research projects in each of 
    the communities of teachers who all won national competitions. This practice-based 
    research community will present and publish case studies, which are intended 
    to facilitate the sharing of knowledge process amongst teachers across the 
    world. </p>
  <h3>Building Our Future </h3>
  <p><img src="promethean_files/building.jpg" alt="Building our Future" title="Building our Future" width="600" height="167"></p>
  <p><img src="promethean_files/rose.jpg" alt="UK project rose" width="80" height="80" align="left">The 
    UK projects are now in their third year, and the impact of ACTIVboards and 
    the technology has changed expectations about what teaching and learning should 
    be for both teachers and pupils. Resource banks and learning objects are shared 
    between colleagues; materials and revision materials are available to pupils 
    through school intranets; a far greater sense of pupil involvement in learning 
    can be observed and pupil enjoyment is enhanced. The novelty of ACTIVboards 
    may have worn off, but their effectiveness is greater than ever. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I can't begin to imagine teaching without my IWB, particularly for literacy 
      and numeracy </li>
    <li>The children are much more aware of the role of technology in their learning 
      and have become competent when using IT themselves. They tend to focus for 
      greater periods of time and their attention is at its best when there is 
      an opportunity to work the board themselves </li>
    <li>The ability to save work done in class is very useful both to pupils who 
      can access it from the school network </li>
    <li>Pupils benefit from clear visual impact and retain information more readily 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Educating a Rainbow Nation </h3>
  <p><img src="promethean_files/educating.jpg" alt="Educating a Rainbow Nation" title="Educating a Rainbow Nation" width="600" height="167"></p>
  <p><img src="promethean_files/strelitzia.jpg" alt="South Africa project strelitzia" width="80" height="80" align="left">Auckland 
    Park Preparatory School and St. Mary's School, both in Johannesburg are using 
    ACTIVboards to involve the entire school community in new approaches to learning. 
    An intensive staff training programme promotes greater pupil interaction and 
    engagement and higher levels of concentration. As for the teachers, the user-friendly 
    software has refreshed ideas and enthusiasm among the staff who are displaying 
    renewed excitement about lesson preparation. ACTIVboards have stimulated innovative 
    thinking about enriching teaching and learning. Pupils now use the board effectively 
    in assignment presentations and have expectations that all lessons be taught 
    through this medium. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It's so cool! </li>
    <li>Lesson preparation has become an interesting and engrossing activity </li>
    <li>I can complete more content in each lesson </li>
    <li>ACTIVboards should be installed on every wall of the classroom! </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The teacher-researchers, collaborating through workshops and online, will 
    be sharing their interactive whiteboard ideas and exchanging resources. The 
    project also actively involves parents and their local communities, which 
    in turn improves citizenship responsibility and racial harmony. Each school 
    believes that by giving young learners a voice, their opportunities for democratic 
    participation and sense of social worth and belonging will be enhanced. </p>
  <p>Teachers in each country are e-mentoring each other as they discover the 
    similarities and differences in their professional preoccupations, challenges 
    and triumphs. </p>
  <h3>Active Citizens </h3>
  <p><img src="promethean_files/active.jpg" alt="Active Citizens" title="Active Citizens" width="600" height="167"></p>
  <p><img src="promethean_files/cactus.jpg" alt="Mexicao project cactus" width="80" height="80" align="left">Pupils 
    and staff in three schools in Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico are integrating 
    ACTIVboards into every aspect of their curriculum. The special focus of their 
    work, however, is Citizenship. The ACTIVboards provide the creative focus 
    for a range of pupil-centred activities that include research, investigative 
    reports, discussion and the creation of cartoons. The teacher-researchers 
    are reporting a profound change in attitudes towards school and learning among 
    all their pupils. The pupils now play an active part in their own learning 
    and as a result, attendance, behaviour and attainment have all improved. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If I don't have the ACTIVboard, I can't understand/learn English </li>
    <li>It makes my job easier. All the great materials that I can use in an instant, 
      make my class more interesting </li>
    <li>I understand the class more and I don't like to play truant </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Creating Learning Changes </h3>
  <p><img src="promethean_files/creating.jpg" alt="Creating Learning Changes" title="Creating Learning Changes" width="600" height="167"></p>
  <p><img src="promethean_files/gerbera.jpg" alt="China project gerbera" width="80" height="80" align="left">Both 
    of the practice-based research centres in China face a similar problem: how 
    to promote active and involved learning, when classes are large. Teachers 
    are tackling this challenge by using ACTIVboards and the ACTIVstudio software 
    to facilitate student group work, enabling a change in pedagogy and shifting 
    pupil and student expectations of learning. Pupils and students are beginning 
    to see themselves as active agents in the learning process, rather than passive 
    recipients of knowledge. At the same time, teachers are able to create more 
    individualised learning materials than previously possible. These materials 
    can be shared widely. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I want to say they are very useful for our study </li>
    <li>It makes lessons more fun and colourful </li>
    <li>I think that every class should have one! They are a new necessity </li>
    <li>Inter-active boards are much better, more colourful and easy to use </li>
    <li>The interactive white boards are really great and I enjoy doing activities 
      on the board </li>
    <li>ACTIVboards rock! </li>
