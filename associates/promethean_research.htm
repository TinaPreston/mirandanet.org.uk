  <p><strong>I<a name="intro"></a>ntroduction</strong></p>
  <p>This three year research programme, 2005 - 2008, aims to provide detailed 
    evidence and advice both for educators and policy makers who are charged with 
    making a difference in the long term, and for teachers and teacher advisers 
    who need access to ideas and advice immediately. The research study focuses 
    on schools in China, Mexico, South Africa and the UK where ACTIVboards are 
    being widely used. </p>
  <p><strong>F<a name="findings"></a>indings from the first phase</strong></p>
  <p>The projects already demonstrate a wide range of reasons for adopting the 
    boards in the first place. Underlying project themes include better achievement 
    in literacy, numeracy and ICT skills. A common thread is to improve the quality 
    of learning by motivating reluctant learners and creating more active learning 
    opportunities. One method which has already been adopted is to make the layout 
    of classrooms more conducive to active learning. </p>
  <p>Lack of resources is a concern in most classrooms. Projects have been designed 
    to improve the design of resources and even to use learners for resource development. 
    Some projects aim to enrich the ICT skills of the staff as well as the learners. 
    Practice based research which includes the publication and presentation of 
    case studies is also intended to facilitate the sharing of knowledge process 
    amongst the school staff. As an international group overall project intentions 
    include increasing the involvement of parents and the local community, improving 
    citizenship responsibility and racial harmony. The schools who belong to this 
    research community across four countries are also committed to the idea that 
    giving young learners&#8217; a voice will also increase the opportunities 
    for democratic participation and a sense of social worth and belonging. </p>
  <p>Specific findings are also emerging in each country. In South Africa where 
    projects have been running for nearly a year, the learners have conducted 
    a survey which reveals that 99% agreed or strongly agreed that they found 
    lessons in which the ACTIVboard is used more enjoyable. In addition more than 
    three quarters of the learners said that when ACTIVboards were used in lessons 
    their concentration was better or much better and so was their understanding 
    and retention of material presented. Compared with other lessons, they talked 
    less to their friends about matters unrelated to work when ACTIVboards were 
    being used. They also wanted more access to the board to do their assignment 
    presentations. More than half the students said that their participation in 
    IWB lessons was better or much better. The schools have purchased more boards 
    on the evidence of effective use. </p>
  <p> The Mexican projects have been running for 9 months already and emergent 
    results are promising. There is evidence that the role of teachers acting 
    as researchers of their own practice has produced:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A transformation in their identities as practitioners towards a more socially 
      recognized role of compromised agents of change in education</li>
    <li>An empowerment in the decision making process for planning of lessons 
      and management within their schools and the State Secretary of Education</li>
    <li>More creativity in the design of educational resources and pedagogical 
      activities in their classrooms</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In China installation of the ACTIVboards has taken longer to organise, but 
    this has been used as an opportunity to redesign classrooms from scratch. 
    In computer labs 60 students were sitting behind computers in 6 rows of 10. 
    This was not felt to be conducive to active learning. One of the teachers 
    has designed circular consoles for 4-6 pupils who can then collaborate and 
    talk as well as working on the computer. The ownership of ACTIVboards has 
    promoted this kind of thinking about the learning environment because all 
    the pupils in large classes can see the main screen. They do not, therefore, 
    need to be behind the small screen for the whole lesson. </p>
  <p>The first phase has mainly been about installation, advanced skills training, 
    negotiating projects and building familiarity with this new learning tool. 
    However, the teachers have already come to some conclusions about the impact 
    of the boards so far. In the judgement of the teachers, all the pupils have 
    been more engaged and focused. The wealth of resources and storage of classroom 
    jottings has made it possible to cover topics in more depth: teachers and 
    pupils have been able to move from one section of the materials to another 
    with ease. Teachers have found that they can cover the syllabus and curriculum 
    materials at greater speed. As a result more time is available for pre-examination 
    revision. It has also been easier to ensure that revision materials are always 
    available to pupils. Most importantly lessons have been more enjoyable and 
    fun for the teachers and the learners who have found a new tool to explore 
    their creativity together. On the issues of measurable attainment emergent 
    findings also suggest that there have been higher attainment in the lower/middle 
    pupil band, but these observations will have to be confirmed by test results 
    in January.</p>
  <p>The research will report each year on the interim findings so that the education 
    community is well informed about progress. However, teachers are who are busy 
    using the boards want immediate advice and information now. That is why the 
    teachers and researchers have set up a Promethean World website (www.mirandanet.org.uk/associates/promethean.htm) 
    where users can find advice and case studies from other teachers who are engaged 
    in a variety of practical uses of the ACTIVboard in a range of setting. 16,056 
    teachers have been regularly downloading case studies and resources from this 
    website in the first year.</p>
  <p><strong>T<a name="methodolgy"></a>he research methodology</strong></p>
  <p>The study is being conducted in two parallel strands. In the first strand 
    quantitative and qualitative evidence from 100 teachers and 1,000 students 
    is being gathered over a three year period to be published in a web knowledge 
    base. Interim and summative evidence, resources and advice on Promethean World 
    for all users will cover a variety of topics like: the detailed ways which 
    the boards are used in different situations, effective classroom layouts, 
    curriculum specialisations, self-evaluation templates, impact on attainment 
    evidence, training issues, resources, methods of integrating knowledge of 
    home computers into formal education, barriers to the use of new tools and 
    suggestions for further software. Students will be reporting, in detail, on 
    the ways in which ACTIVboards support their learning in detail. The analysis 
    will concentrate on evidence of broadening and deepening learning over this 
    period. Cultural differences between the countries will also help to increase 
    understanding of teachers&#8217; and learners&#8217; needs in context. </p>
  <p>The second part of the research concentrates on the findings from a group 
    of 10 schools and colleges which represent a variety of socio-economic backgrounds 
    and educational phases in China, Mexico, South Africa and the UK. These schools 
    won an international competition for a place on this Continuing Professional 
    Development programme because of their innovative approach to learning and 
    their commitment to change. Each of the schools represents a wider community 
    of users who they are also training in the use of the ACTIVboards. This aspect 
    of the research aims at providing evidence for policy makers, teacher educators 
    and senior managers in schools who want to ensure that the full potential 
    of the board is used by teachers. These outstanding institutions and the communities 
    they serve are pooling their resources and working together to share their 
    thinking and practice with researchers and managers. The aim is to move beyond 
    advanced skills training. This &#8216;community of enquiry&#8217; is being 
    supported to take a holistic view of learning technologies in their local 
    environment in attainment and change. They also have the opportunity to judge 
    their achievements against international evidence of attainment. Through this 
    kind of cross-cultural exchange questions will, undoubtedly, be raised about 
    the nature of attainment and achievement as well as the quality of learning 
    and its application and the meaning of the transformation of learning.</p>
  <p>These 10 educational institutions have been set up as a &#8216;community 
    of enquiry&#8217; in order to discover how well learners can achieve when 
    they and their teachers have the right kind of support available both for 
    &#8216;thinking&#8217; and &#8216;doing&#8217;. Each school has a research 
    mentor and learning and training advisers attached. Residential workshops 
    and on-line support are an important element of the research which is being 
    conducted within a customised learning environment which includes a gallery 
    for published work. </p>
  <p>Core teachers in this community of enquiry are being trained to be teacher 
    researchers in their own right in the tradition of practice-based research. 
    This kind of approach to CPD means that the school can identify ways in which 
    the board might be effective, set up an investigation in the classroom and 
    report on the results. These reports are published for other teachers and 
    can also be used as evidence of progress for school inspectors, governors 
    and government policy makers. The aim is to develop understanding and change 
    practice through a long-term shift in conceptions of how ICT can be embedded 
    in classroom practices. The &#8216;community of enquiry&#8217; will be encouraged 
    to use this new knowledge to shape learning outcomes that are a better match 
    with the learners&#8217; needs. The activities focus on the learners who are 
    also encouraged to reflect on what works and what does not work in their own 
    learning journey. This is in line with research which indicates that learners 
    are more motivated when they are engaged with the process of learning as well 
    as the products. </p>
  <p> <strong>T<a name="themes"></a>he research themes</strong></p>
  <p>In these optimum conditions the &#8216;community of enquiry&#8217; is expected 
    to supply evidence on the themes of learning and teaching theory and practice; 
    the role of communities of enquiry in education systems; learning dialogues 
    and creative thinking ; the provision and management of effective virtual 
    and real learning environments; the impact of &#8216;out of school&#8217; 
    learning; the contribution of new tools to social communication and advice 
    on regional and national infrastructure for policy makers. In the nature of 
    rapid change themes will emerge which are not yet in common currency and cannot 
    yet be foreseen. By allowing evidence to emerge throughout the three years 
    of the project the team expect to provide knowledge about the future of learning 
    with technological tools for potential purchasers. </p>
  <p><img src="../images/ACTIV.jpg" alt="eLapa Students at BETT05" width="200" height="150" hspace="5" align="right">The 
    team are also increase their understanding of the community in which learning 
    is situated by interviewing those who are attached to the project : the learning 
    and teaching advisers, the researchers, the senior management teams, the policy 
    makers, the resellers, the specialist journalists, the community leaders and 
    the school governors. This will provide wider insights into the issues of 
    policy and distribution as well as underlying motives for purchase. </p>
  <p>The universities which are supporting the research are all leaders in innovation 
    in Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for teachers in Information and 
    Communication Technology (ICT) : The Beijing Academy of Educational Sciences, 
    China, Pretoria University, South Africa and researchers at the UNESCO North 
    Committee in Monterrey who are working with the Nuevo Le&oacute;n State Government 
    in Mexico as well as the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le&oacute;n. The project 
    is being directed by the MirandaNet International Research Centre (MIRC), 
    Education Department at Southampton University, UK. All the researchers, mentors 
    and schools are drawn from the MirandaNet Fellowship which has an international 
    reputation for practice-based research which bases the development of new 
    theories about tools for learning on sound classroom practice. The Fellowship 
    is also a leader in supporting the development of web-based learning communities 
    amongst educators world-wide. Recent research for government and industry 
    include reports on the UK national training programme in ICT for teachers 
    and on teacher motivation in ICT for the Teacher Training Agency, an evaluation 
    of the British Computer Society Computer Driving Licence and of Curriculum 
    on Line training for BECTA. MirandaNet has also developed ICT CPD programmes 
    for governments in South Africa and Chile and evaluated national projects 
    in Brazil and Eastern Europe. Educators and schools who work in these projects 
    gain an international perspective on citizenship from the opportunity to share 
    their thinking with learners from other nations and communities. </p>
