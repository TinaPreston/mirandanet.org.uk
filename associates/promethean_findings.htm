    Research Project Conference in Mexico Begins to Reveal Key Findings</h3>
  <p><a href="#key">Key Findings</a> | <a href="#hurdle">Getting over the Hurdle</a> 
    | <a href="#cascading">Cascading Education</a> </p>
  <p>Across 4 countries, nearly 4000 children with age ranges from 5 to 18 are 
    continuing their &#8216;action research&#8217; project into the benefits of 
    using Activboards in teaching and learning.</p>
  <p>T<a name="key"></a>his unique research project is now revealing key findings 
    about the positive impact of using Activboards:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Greatly improved attendance by students &#8211; they love the impact of 
      interactivity in their lessons so don&#8217;t want to miss any of them</li>
    <li> Improved student information retention &#8211; students find that because 
      the technology facilitates individual learning styles they are able to retain 
      and remember things easier because of the learning links it creates in their 
      minds.</li>
    <li> Motivated teachers &#8211;teachers involved in the research are beginning 
      to get recognising for the value of their new found talents, as a result 
      they are highly motivated to improve their lessons.</li>
    <li> Sharing of resources &#8211; having realised the value and simplicity 
      of digital resources teachers have begun to develop e-communities through 
      which they are improving the overall sharing of resources.</li>
    <li> Improved quality of students&#8217; work &#8211; teachers from Number 
      50 School in Beijing report a marked improvement in the quality of their 
      students&#8217; work, which seems to be directly related to their understanding 
      of subject areas covered. Children also seem to be covering work quicker 
      and with greater ease than before.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> The project, which is being undertaken by MirandaNet and sponsored by Promethean, 
    includes researchers from UK, China, South Africa and Mexico. Delegates gathered 
    for the <a href="promethean_ambassadors_monterrey.htm">week long 
    conference and workshop in Monterey, Mexico</a> from the 25th to 31st of March 
    2006. This unique 3 year project hosts an annual conference in each of the 
    countries involved in the project. The aim is to discuss findings and share 
    best practice from the project. Last year in Cape Town, South Africa, this 
    year in Monterey, Mexico and for 2007, in its final year, the research conference 
    will be hosted in Beijing, China.</p>
  <p>The ambassadors&#8217; workshops and conference in Monterey began at 8.30 
    am each morning. Teachers and researchers developed their evidence and best 
    practice into a full seminar which was presented at the Teatro Universitario 
    unidad Mederos University. The presentation, on Friday 31st of March, was 
    entitled &#8216;Interchange of Successful Experiences&#8217; and the key message 
    was how technology is &#8216;transforming teaching, transforming learning, 
    transforming lives&#8217;. The day began with a full Mexican Civic Ceremony. 
    Officially hosted by the Secretary of Education for the region of Nuevo Leon 
    in Mexico, Prof. Maria Yolanda Blanco Garcia, who welcomed over 600 Mexican 
    teachers to the event. </p>
  <p>This year&#8217;s conference and workshops have allowed the teacher researchers 
    to bring a sense of understanding of both the unique differences and similarities 
    of children throughout the world today. </p>
  <p>Teachers from Number 50 School in Beijing, China have 2700 pupils and 55 
    classrooms. They are also challenged with approximately 50 pupils in each 
    class. Their experience of pupils using the boards is very positive as students 
    are presenting their work on the boards before the lessons begin. </p>
  <p>Whilst in Mexico the teaching day is split into two shifts to facilitate 
    the number of children as there are not enough schools.</p>
  <h3> G<a name="hurdle"></a>etting Over The Hurdle</h3>
  <p>During the study researchers have found that the teacher&#8217;s lack of 
    ICT skills was initially a barrier to the adoption of IWB technology. They 
    also found that this lack of skills held teachers back in their career prospects. 
    This skills gap was identified as lack of personal ownership of IT. The project 
    is now beginning to reveal that as teachers have become well versed in the 
    use of the technology they are becoming more motivated and progressing their 
    lesson content and delivery further.</p>
  <p>Christina Preston, Director of MirandaNet says<em> &#8220;Teachers in the 
    project are reporting improved outcomes for themselves since the installation 
    of their Activboards. Since developing new IT skills they are now better able 
    to motivate their students. They are also seeing the benefits of sharing their 
    work and lesson plans. The impact is a truly collaborative effect for both 
    teachers and learners.&#8221;</em></p>
  <h3> C<a name="cascading"></a>ascading Education</h3>
  <p>Because learning is a life long process this project has seen the benefits 
    of embracing all learners from the outset. The continued professional development 
    of the teachers involved, is clearly evident throughout the results as teacher 
    motivation is seen to be impacting positively on their children&#8217;s&#8217; 
    learning. </p>
  <p>Furthermore teachers are cascading their own enthusiasm down to colleagues. 
    This in turn is having a truly motivational impact on the whole school.</p>
  <p>Stephen Jury, CEO at Promethean confirms, <em>&#8220;We are very excited 
    to see such positive outcomes from this project. Especially since the impact 
    is relative to both teachers and learners.</em></p>
  <p><em>We were extremely pleased to have such generous support and involvement 
    from the Secretary of Education for the region of Nuevo Leon. </em></p>
  <p><em>The project is still in its infancy yet and we hope that over the full 
    3 year period it will provide even greater insight into how technology can 
    be used to &#8216;light the flame of learning&#8217; for everyone.</em></p>
