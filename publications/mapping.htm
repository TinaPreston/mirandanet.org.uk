  <h2>Mapping: What&#8217;s it all about?</h2>
  <p> By <a href="../fellowship/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=4.html">Christina Preston</a></p>
  <p> <em>Visual thinking and learning tools such as Mind Mapping and Concept 
    Mapping are making an impact in today&#8217;s classrooms. Christina Preston, 
    Founder and Chair of the MirandaNet Fellowship, explains what the concept 
    is, how it is helping students and how ICT is taking it to new levels.</em></p>
  <h3> What is visual learning?</h3>
  <p>Visual learning is a proven teaching method in which diagrams such as concept 
    maps, mind maps, tree diagrams, organisation charts and spider diagrams are 
    used to help students of all ages think and learn more effectively. They are 
    all used for storing, processing, organising and presenting information graphically. 
    These techniques are used across the curriculum and at all Key Stages in the 
    UK. The most popular are Concept Mapping and Mind Mapping.</p>
  <h3>What is Concept Mapping?</h3>
  <p>The Concept Mapping technique was developed by Prof. Joseph D. Novak at Cornell 
    University in the 1960s. Concept maps graphically illustrate relationships 
    between information. In a concept map, two or more concepts are linked by 
    words that describe their relationship.</p>
  <p>Concept maps encourage understanding by helping students to organise and 
    enhance their knowledge on any topic. They help students learn new information 
    by integrating each new idea into their existing body of knowledge. </p>
  <p>Concept maps are ideal for measuring the growth of student learning. As students 
    create concept maps, they reiterate ideas using their own words. Misdirected 
    links or wrong connections can alert teachers to gaps or misunderstandings 
    in their students&#8217; knowledge. In this way concept mapping provides an 
    accurate, objective way to evaluate particular areas requiring additional 
    explanation to complete students&#8217; understanding. </p>

  <h3>What is Mind Mapping?</h3>
  <p>Mind Mapping&reg; was first coined in the UK by Tony Buzan in his 1974 book 
    and BBC TV programme &#8220;Use Your Head&#8221;. A mind map is a visual representation 
    of hierarchical information. Students follow a process of building a mind 
    map, to represent an entire concept or an idea with branches of associated 
    thoughts. As with other visual learning techniques, mind maps provide a simplified 
    overview of complex information allowing students to better understand relationships 
    and to find new connections. </p>
  <p>Mind maps include a central idea or image surrounded by branches of associated 
    topics or ideas. Subtopics are then added to the branches as ideas flow freely. 
    Typically in a mind map, topic and subtopic text is one to two keywords, to 
    provide a reminder for what the idea is. More information is then detailed 
    in attached notes. </p>
  <p>Mind mapping is a commonly used tool for brainstorming and note taking. The 
    process of building a mind map is very fluid and nonlinear, making the expansion 
    of ideas similar to the natural way of thinking. Symbols and images, along 
    with keywords, are used to quickly retain and recall information. Branches 
    are often in different colours to help students to remember the different 
    branches and their associations.</p>

  <h3>How does Mind Mapping and Concept Mapping support learning?</h3>
  <p>The use of visual learning techniques, such as mapping, is achieving growing 
    recognition in education. Whether we believe that the mind is organised into 
    left and right-hand sides, or whether it is a less organised structure of 
    various skills, mapping utilises a greater part of the brain, resulting in 
    more effective thinking. Imagination and association are the keys to high-level 
    memory and creative thinking and mapping supports this. With many students 
    being visual or kinaesthetic learners, this approach makes the teaching more 
    enjoyable and effective and the learning more successful and fun. It is an 
    educational win&#8211;win that multiplies its benefits over time and with 
    use.</p>
  <p>Concept maps and mind maps are quick to review and it is easy to refresh 
    information in the mind just by glancing at one. Remembering the shape and 
    structure of a visual diagram can provide cues necessary to remember the information 
    within it. They engage much more of the brain in the process of assimilation 
    and connecting facts than conventional notes or summaries.</p>
  <h3> How does ICT take Concept Mapping and Mind Mapping further?</h3>
  <p>The application of ICT can act as a catalyst for change in teaching and learning. 
    In terms of visual learning, technology takes the student from a 2D paper 
    based map into a multi-layered environment. </p>
  <p>With ICT Visual Learning tools:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Graphics and symbols can be used to highlight the nodes</li>
    <li>Labels that can be attached to the links</li>
    <li>Maps can easily be re-organised in a variety of ways to make the picture 
      clear</li>
    <li>Maps can be hyperlinked to other maps creating a complex multi-layered 
      system for understanding an idea</li>
    <li>Elements within the map can be &#8220;hyperlinked&#8221; to files, websites 
      and other digital resources</li>
    <li>Multimedia files, such as MP3 and Movie files, could be inserted and played 
      directly from the document</li>
    <li>Cross curricular templates and resources so that teacher and students 
      can get started quickly</li>
  </ul>
  <p>ICT also helps to support the development of higher order thinking skills. 
    Inspiration&reg; (Ages 7 to adult) and Kidspiration&reg; (for students age 
    4-10 years) have been designed specially for the education market, and the 
    latest version of Inspiration includes access to more than one million symbols 
    to help visualise ideas. MirandaNet fellows have been researching how younger 
    children learn to use both language and images to make meaning of the world 
    and also how children source and choose the images to represent their ideas. 
    New multimedia functionality also enables students to insert and play video 
    and sound directly from their maps to enrich projects. </p>
  <p>Inspiration features three unique learning environments which mean that students 
    can build their diagrams, concept or mind maps and then transfer them into 
    text outlines. This means that students who may struggle to get their thoughts 
    down in a linear way can pour all their ideas onto the page, reorganise them, 
    link them up and, by transferring to the outline view, have the satisfaction 
    of seeing their ideas made into a structured story or argument. Teachers have 
    commented on how this can raise the self esteem of students who struggle with 
    writing, especially with boys who are initially engaged by the ICT aspect 
    of this way of working but who come out of the process having gained valuable 
    thinking and learning skills. Inspirations Word Guide, dictionary and thesaurus 
    also aid writing and literacy by giving students more scope for expression. 
  </p>
  <p>These ICT tools can also enhance the experience for auditory learners. Inspiration 
    and Kidspiration both have audio tools which allow auditory learners to see 
    their ideas visually as well as hearing the words spoken aloud. The listen 
    tool reads aloud any text a student inputs. The record tool allows emerging 
    writers to record their own words and hear it spoken aloud. Last but not least 
    the talking interface will read aloud all program elements to the students, 
    so if a student scrolls over an item anywhere in the program, the voice will 
    say it aloud making Inspiration and Kidspiration great tools for audio and 
    visual learners.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, ICT allows you to expand your ideas by visualising connections 
    and concepts, in a way that you cannot on paper. With paper based mapping 
    you can run out of space or find it is frustrating to add ideas or move them 
    around. The functionality of ICT means that the area for expression is expanded 
    so that space issues do not get in the way of the thought process. </p>
  <p>The choice between concept mapping and mind mapping is one of personal preference; 
    however what is clear is that ultimately teachers seem to agree that both 
    are powerful thinking skills that can offer benefits to all students. What 
    is also clear is that using ICT to undertake this process has the potential 
    to extend the flexibility and scope of this approach even further.</p>
