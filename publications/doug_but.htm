  <p>Maths in Sydney, Melbourne &amp; Hong Kong 30 Nov - 7 Dec 1999<br>
    <a href="../fellowship/profile.php%EF%B9%96prof=39.html">Douglas Butler</a></p>
  <p>The objective was to take the opportunity to share some of my ideas about 
    using computer-based methods in the teaching and learning of mathematics, 
    with teachers in Australia and Hong Kong, and to learn from them about their 
    experiences of its effectiveness. In many ways Australia is about 4 years 
    ahead of us, certainly in teacher IT competence, but I found them struggling 
    a bit with subject specific applications.</p>
  <h2>Sydney</h2>
  <p>My first task though on arriving in Sydney was to visit the Sydney Olympic 
    site and do a live report for Oundle School's OSCAR radio station (87.7FM) 
    (Tuesday 8am = Monday 9pm in Oundle) using my mobile phone. A nice practical 
    use of today's technology - apparently I came over loud and clear!</p>
  <p>School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Technology, Sydney: presentation 
    to a good cross-section of secondary teachers from the Sydney region. Australia 
    has a much more mature use of the internet and IT in education than we do, 
    but it was surprising to find these teachers at about the same stage in the 
    use of software in mathematics as a similar group would be in the UK.</p>
  <p>Sydney Grammar School: a highly academic down-town boys grammar school. The 
    teachers' work area is based round a well established PC network with a terminal 
    on every teacher's desk. I have seen similar arrangements in Singapore and 
    firmly believe that a school network will never really take off until it is 
    freely available at every teacher's main work desk (and study at home).</p>
  <p>Music technology: I visited a lesson on composition being taught very effectively 
    using a sequencer and score-writer (Cubase). I was impressed by the lesson 
    objectives and how the technology was facilitating the learning process.</p>
  <p>Mathematics Department INSET - I then led a 2-hour session with the 16 full 
    time mathematicians in the lab: as usual the teachers are all at different 
    stages - clearly some very proficient computer users, others very timid. My 
    session covered using Word for mathematical work-sheets, and links with internet 
    text and graphics. I also covered the use of Autograph as a teaching tool.</p>
  <p>Interesting to note the general attitude of the NSW mathematics curriculum:</p>
  <p>there is an emphasis on depth rather than pushing on as we do to more and 
    more topics (as in our Further Maths). Not much applied maths either - akin 
    in that sense to the IB. The consequence is they often have success in competitions 
    at a national level. The department further strengthens its academic base 
    with regular exchanges with the University of Sydney.</p>
  <h2>Melbourne</h2>
  <p>I then gave 2 presentations at the Mathematics Association of Victoria conference 
    on the theme of using IT and the internet. These seemed to strike a chord 
    and they were interested in the UK approach. I had some interesting discussions 
    with members for their "Board of Studies" who write the syllabuses (different 
    for each State!). What really impressed me was that this was just a state 
    conference, but it attracted 2200 teachers. The UK national Maths Association 
    conference rarely gets over 250 teachers.</p>
  <p>There is a much more established approach to professional development in 
    Australia - regular sabbaticals, and time off to attend conferences and INSET. 
    Most IT managers I met considered all their teachers to have been trained 
    up to a minimum competency in IT about 5 years ago.</p>
  <p>The state curricula are trying to merge, but, if mathematics is anything 
    to go by, it will not be an easy task. Quite a different philosophy in each 
    State. CUP have commissioned a complete series of texts for each State - which 
    is a bit like having a separate text book for 4 London LEAs!</p>
  <h2>Hong Kong</h2>
  <p>In Hong Kong I met with officials from the education dept at Hong Kong University, 
    and the Centre for Information Technology in Education (CITE). Gave a presentation 
    to 50 teachers in the provincial city of Tuen Mun (near the Chinese mainland 
    border), at the South Tuen Mun Secondary School. They were all ages and very 
    keen to pick up ideas on using IT. Spoken English was excellent. Their Dept 
    of Education very keen to increase the use of IT throughout the curriculum, 
    so this was well timed. Some pressure from Beijing to reduce spoken English 
    in schools, but Heads are keen to retain it.</p>
  <p>The Hong Kong Education Dept will, through CITE, be incorporating some of 
    my ideas in the new draft of their secondary curriculum that is being worked 
    on now for 2001.</p>
  <p>Also visited the Chinese International School - they do the I.B., which involves 
    huge dissertations in each subject, and 6 subjects right through to the end 
    of year 12. I saw some of the mathematics dissertations that make our GCSE 
    and A-level coursework look very tame.</p>
