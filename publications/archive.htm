  <h2>Key publications about professionals learning online : social networking
    and braided learning</h2>
  <p><strong>1. Preston, C. &quot;Social networking between professionals - what
      is the point?&quot; (&copy; Taconet, 2007)</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
  <p>This article addresses the issue that most of the research into the impact
    of open social networking concentrates on groups that are engaged in leisure
    pursuits where the outcomes are more about making initial contacts than building
    knowledge collaboratively. Some evidence of more purposeful activity is found
    in some closed learning platforms developed for young learners in schools.
    In terms of adult learners, researchers like Salmon and de Laat have investigated
    the more productive online activity that takes place in learning platforms
    designed for the delivery of courses. However, evidence of adult collaborative
    knowledge building is sparse in this context: firstly because the networking
    activity is confined to a course that has a finite time span, and, secondly
    because the learners tend to stop communicating online when they have the
    final individual assignment to complete for accreditation. This reinforces
    isolated learning at the end of a course rather than consolidating the group
    knowledge that has been accumulated. The emergent evidence for collaborative
    learning is drawn in this paper from the debates between members of two professional
    organisations for educators; the MirandaNet Fellowship which is international
    and Naace, which is UK based. These two organisations qualify as 'communities
    of practice' (CoPs) according to the Wenger and Lave definition which is
    explained later. My long term membership of these groups has permitted privileged
    insights into our collaborative learning progress over two decades. The evidence
    suggests that these e-mature CoP members are slowly devising techniques to
    co-operate remotely in three key areas that move beyond Salmon's 5&shy;step
    online model of engagement. This step 6, which is called Braided Learning,
    identifies three new strands of activity. The first is to produce a collaborative
    text that influences professional theory, policy and practice. The second
    is to co-operate on creating new professional theory, policy and practice.
    The third is to make alliances between group in order to benefit from members
    strengths.</p>

  <h2><a name="davis"></a>Key Publications about ICT Continuing Professional Development</h2>
  <p><strong>1. Davis, N. E., C. Preston, et al. (submitted 2007). &quot;Theoretical
          and evaluation frameworks to inform technology-related professional
      development for teachers, tested with evidence from a national study of
      ICT professional
        development for teachers.&quot; </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>This paper re-examines the evidence from a national initiative to train
    all teachers in England to bring them up to the level of newly qualified
    teachers who are required to know when to use, and when not to use, Information
    and Communications Technology (ICT) in their professional practice. Data
    gathered for the 2004 evaluation of the programme uncovers the complexity
    of such professional development. Multiple sources of evidence are provided
    on the effectiveness of contrasting approaches to ICT-related teacher training.
    This data was analysed including a national survey of 496 trainees, and experts&#8217; reports
    on 16 of the 47 training providers was analysed using Guskey&#8217;s (2002)
    five levels of professional development evaluation: participants&#8217; reactions;
    participants&#8217; learning; organizational support and change; participants&#8217; use
    of new knowledge and skills; and, students&#8217; learning outcomes. This
    first analysis showed Guskey&#8217;s levels to be robust for ICT-related
    teacher training, including a significant correlation between the experts&#8217; views
    and those of teachers who had undergone training. The evidence confirms the
    value of an ecological perspective (Davis, 2008, in press). The most effective
    training supports change with ICT in macro and micro ecologies, including
    the classroom, the school, and training provider&#8217;s region. ICT-related
    teacher training using an &#8216;information transfer&#8217; approach is
    not appropriate, despite its success in commercial train.</p>

  <p><strong>2. Davis, N., C. Preston, et al. (submitted 2007). &quot;ICT teacher
      training impacts multiple ecologies: evidence from a national initiative.&quot; </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong> </p>
  <p>The design of continuing professional development to enable teachers to
    use ICT in teaching and learning is little researched, despite increasing
    demand for it in the twenty-first century. A national initiative for ICT
    teacher training in England provided the opportunity to contrast two training
    designs, only one of which was highly rated by teachers and educational ICT
    experts. The highly rated design adopted an &#8216;organic&#8217; approach
    that provided training in schools, whereas the contrasted design efficiently
    deployed computer-based training materials facilitated by on-line access
    to trainers. Although both designs used on-line communities of practice,
    the better rated design deployed it for ICT trainers in training, rather
    than for teachers in training. The contrast of the two designs provides support
    for an ecological view of the diffusion of IT innovations in education (Davis,
    2008, in press). The decentralized organic model of ICT teacher training
    supported the evolution of ecosystems of the classroom and the school, as
    well as the development of training for ICT teacher trainers. In contrast,
    the centralized model caused more disruption in these educational ecosystems.
    Recommendations include adoption of an ecological perspective when designing
    ICT teacher training. </p>

  <p><strong>3. Preston, C. and J. Cuthell (2007). The Perspectives of Professional
      Educators on ICT CPD: Past, Present, Future.</strong> N.&nbsp;Pachler.
      London, Naace, MirandaNet Fellowship, WLE, Institute of Education, University
      of London. </p>
  <p>MirandaNet have produced a report, funded by the Institute of Education's
    Centre for Excellence in Work-based Learning (WLE), investigating teachers'.
    advisers' and teacher educators' professional development needs in ICT with
    250 members of the IT specialist groups Naace, ITTE and MirandaNet.</p>
  <p>The report found that around a third of the respondents had received no
    ICT training for three years and some ten per cent had never had any form
    of formal instruction. Practice-based training, rather than skills-based
    or academic courses, were deemed most useful by 41%. In terms of motives
    for using ICT, equipping learners to be independent featured prominently
    (48%) as did international collaborations (19%). Very few respondents made
    any link to supporting vocational learning &shy; a key strand of the new
    14-19 curriculum.</p>
  <p>In terms of ICT CPD needed for the future, there was a split in opinion
    with Naace members identifying learning platforms as the priority while ITTE
    and MirandaNet members pinpointed a need for practice-based courses and applied
    research.</p>

        and trainers' perspectives : an evaluation of the English NOF ICT teacher
        training programme
    1999-2003.</strong> London, MirandaNet and the Teacher Training Agency</p>
  <p>[<a href="../tta/index.html">More information...
    </a>]</p>
  <p><strong>Some highlights from the findings:</strong> </p>
  <ul>
	  <li>The school culture and leadership</li>
	</ul>
    <p>&quot;The culture of the schools and the leaders' attitude was crucial
      to the success of the programme from the start.&quot;</p>
    <ul>
	  <li>Improvements in training over the 3 years</li>
	</ul>
    <p>&quot;The training in our school had the effect of 'kick starting' much
      of the ICT work both as individuals and in class teaching. Without the
      training many teachers would still be frightened of ICT.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;The programme showed a considerable degree of improvement, particularly
      in the last year, resulting in over 75% of teachers completing the training.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;By the time of this MirandaNet survey the ATPs and the participants
      had made so many changes and adjustments in the programme that the measured
      data are significantly different from the data collected by earlier research.&quot;</p>
    <ul>
	  <li>Inadequate access to ICTs</li>
	</ul>
    <p>&quot;Despite 12 UK government ICT initiatives since 1974, not enough
      teachers had adequate ICT tools and/or competence to make full use of the
      programme about the pedagogy of ICT.&quot;</p>
    <ul>
	  <li>The quality of the trainers</li>
	</ul>
    <p>&quot;Many ATPs had not anticipated the wide variety of skill levels of
      teachers.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;The quality of the trainer was the factor most commented on, both
      in the negative and the positive comments.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;One of the major factors in learning was the quality of the trainer.
      Many of them were highly praised.&quot;</p>
    <ul>
	  <li>Blended learning</li>
	</ul>
    <p>&quot;Among the schools (ATPs explained that) there was an overwhelming
      preference for the face-to-face delivery model.&quot;</p>
    <ul>
	  <li>Achievements</li>
	</ul>
    <p>&quot;Over 290,000 teachers have completed their training which is a major
      achievement for the teachers, their schools and the trainers.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Evidence suggests that a large majority of teachers did make progress
      by making creative use of the opportunity offered.&quot; </p>

        evaluation of what motivates teachers to use ICT.</strong> TTA, Compaq
        and Oracle.</p>
    <p>This small-scale study investigated how teachers can be helped to integrate
      ICT effectively into their teaching. We decided to use a sample of teachers
      who had overcome most barriers and were motivated to use ICT in their teaching
      on a regular basis to explore the factors that had led to their uptake
      and sustained use of ICT. In order to obtain such a sample, we sent 135
      questionnaires to teachers and other educators who were members of three
      professional ICT in education associations, namely MirandaNet, National
      Association of Co-ordinators and Teachers of IT (ACITT), and TeacherNet,
      and their colleagues who were regular users of ICT including the Internet.
      These associations provide support for the practices and professional development
      of teachers using ICT. (<a href="../ftp/cox_summ_forw.pdf">Download
