  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p><img src="digital_day/law_department_mininotes.gif" alt="Law Department mini-notes" title="Law Department mini-notes" width="288" height="216" style="float:right; padding: 5px">Since the day that I became a Mirandanet Fellowship scholar I have enjoyed
    the many exchanges by email with colleagues around the world and I have been
    fascinated by the diversity of opinion and the wide-ranging technical levels
    of those involved. I have often struggled to understand the technical complexities
    and feel a fraud, and then on the other hand someone will postulate a &#8216;new&#8217; idea
    and I think &#8216;been there, done that, moved on&#8217;. I am resolutely
    an end-user. I rely on my more technically minded colleagues to understand
    how something happens and I step back when I think that I am getting too
    close to the &#8216;techie&#8217; stuff. My teaching innovation becomes creative
    because I don&#8217;t know that something is impossible! When I innocently
    ask &#8220;can we do this?&#8221; a more knowledgeable colleague will say &#8220;No&#8221;.
    When I persevere they sometimes say &#8220;Well, maybe&#8221;. I want my
    ICT to be market-orientated not product-orientated. I want to be able to
    say this is how I want to teach in the future can you find out how I can
    do that with ICT. I find it frustrating when a company tells me they have
    come up with a brilliant new front-end for a standard idea and expect me
    to come up with a way to use it.</p>
  <p>I thought that one way of seeing where I am in the scheme of things would
    be to let MirandaNetters comment, if they want to, on the way I do things
    now, and in the way of good teaching practice I thought the ubiquitous journal
    would explain. So here is a digital day in the life of a rural Essex school.</p>
  
  <h4>Last Check</h4>
  <p><strong>Wednesday: 1700</strong></p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/outlook.jpg" alt="Outlook" title="Outlook" width="286" height="214" style="float:right; padding: 5px">I was in as usual at 0700 today, and in the way of a busy teacher&#8217;s
      life I am almost ready to go home and do some marking and 6th Form revision
      panic sessions. The students are able to email me on my school email account
      which is useful as I haven&#8217;t got round to sorting out the secure blog
      site yet. Threaded conversations were possible using our last Personalised
      Learning Environment, but it is not yet available on our latest version.
      Still email seems to work well.</p>
  <p>Checking my school email using Outlook is handy as by using the Outlook
    Today I can remind myself of tomorrow&#8217;s lessons and meetings and see
    if there is anything needing to be done on my Task List. A quick look at
    the BBC News ticker also gives me an idea for tomorrow&#8217;s cryptic news
    question that I give the Law students every lesson to keep them up to date
    with current affairs and the latest changes to the law. A nice ongoing story
    about M.P.&#8217;s expenses has a video clip of a Home Office Minister resigning.
    I&#8217;ll show that tomorrow using the interactive SmartBoard in the classroom.</p>
  <h4>Remote Access</h4>
  <p><strong>Wednesday: 2000</strong></p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/remote_icon.jpg" alt="Remote Logon" title="Remote Logon" width="100" height="75" style="float:right; padding: 5px">Dinner
    and family phone calls over. It is great to speak to the grandchildren using
    Skype. I was able to help a couple of 6th Formers
      with last minute problems with their revision by logging in remotely to
    my school email account using the remote access icon on my desktop. It is
    fantastic
      to be able to log in remotely without fuss to my desktop at school using
      Terminal Services Client. The initial gremlins have been overcome so I
    don&#8217;t
      bother to use a memory stick anymore for the day to day stuff. It will certainly
      save any embarrassment caused by losing a memory stick containing confidential
      information or student work. Logging on also gave me the opportunity to update
      my student&#8217;s marking on my spreadsheet at school and check their work
      on the blended online Law site that we use in conjunction with the textbook.
    Why doesn&#8217;t everybody do this?</p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/nelson_thornes.jpg" alt="AQQ Law on Nelson Thornes" title="AQQ Law on Nelson Thornes" width="384" height="211"></p>
  <h4>Logging In/Setup</h4>
  <p><strong>Thursday: 0615</strong></p>
  <p>Just quickly logon and make sure I don&#8217;t have an appointment with
    the AET in the other building up the road before going into school.</p>
  <h4>Morning Registration</h4>
  <p><strong>Thursday: 0830</strong></p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/eportal.jpg" alt="ePortal" title="ePortal" width="218" height="127" style="float:right; padding: 5px">It
    is nearly time for my Year 11 Form to leave school finally, after five years,
    for their examinations. I&#8217;ll probably miss them,
      but don&#8217;t tell them that! Anyway, they are in today, so morning registration
      then PSHEE at lunchtime registration. The electronic registration software
      has recently been updated to the latest version. It is very handy to be
      able to register the Form, check that they then go to class and not &#8216;bunk
      off&#8217;, get their private details when I need to ring their parents
      about their reports and advocacy day statements, and all in one place.
      Found it
      useful today to match my timetable with one of my students so that I can
      take them out of class for a mentoring session.</p>
  <h4>&#8216;A&#8217; Level Law Lesson (Yr 12)</h4>
  <p><strong>Thursday: 0835 &#8211; 1015</strong></p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/law_department_mininotes.gif" width="229" height="171" alt="Law Department mini-notes" title="Law Department mini-notes" style="float:right; padding: 5px">I left the HP mini-note laptops in the LapSafe on charge for
        the start of the lesson while we caught up with the news update. Two
    of the students then used the SmartBoard to recap yesterday&#8217;s lesson.
    Their interactive board skills are improving all the time and they have started
        to use the facility more when they prepare and give their own lessons
    on
        a new topic. They relish the experience of teaching their peers once
    the shock of their first time has worn off. They still like to produce PowerPoint
        as well I notice. Even those that say they get too many PowerPoint when
    they
        complete the department questionnaire on SharePoint.</p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/lapsafe.jpg" alt="LapSafe" title="LapSafe" width="140" height="185" style="float:left; padding: 5px">About one third of the way through the lesson I give out the mini laptops.
    We have completed the new topic and they now need to do the online exercise
    that goes with the textbook. It was amazing that it only took two lessons
    for the novelty to wear off. They very much look on the laptops as just an
    electronic textbook. The laptops are effectively thin client with access
    via Terminal Services Client which means there are no issues with firewalls
    or any temptation to upload software.</p>
  <p>The pilot small scale research project that I did last year using thin client
    PCs has paid off enormously. I got my twenty mini laptops and LapSafe, and
    the success of them has led to a Wolfson Foundation grant to get many more
    for the Science Department. They are ecstatic and Science teachers now talk
    to me.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Break/Duty</h4>
  <p><strong>Thursday: 1015 &#8211; 1035</strong></p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/dell_axim_x51v.jpg" alt="Dell Axim x51v PDA" title="Dell Axim x51v PDA" width="109" height="147" style="float:left; padding: 5px">On
    duty, outside, on the Astroturf. Sad gadget boy that I am, I have my personal
    Dell Axim x51v PDA with me and use it to check my emails. (My Business Studies
    background reminds me that I am not a gadget boy at all, but an &#8216;early
    adopter&#8217;!) Good job that I did, as there is a message that I have an
    urgent cover for half of the next lesson. My own fault, I did volunteer to
    be on standby.</p>
  
  <h4 class="clear">Science Lesson Cover</h4>
  <p><strong>Thursday: 1035 &#8211; 1215</strong></p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/pda.jpg" alt="Laptop" title="Laptop" width="122" height="92" style="float:right; padding: 5px">What an amazing lesson. Year 8 were measuring temperatures,
      recording the results, drawing graphs and then writing up their experiments.
      Until recently this involved using data-loggers, which produced the results
      in their own format, which in turn were transferred to another piece of
    kit, which displayed the results, but not in a standard format.</p>
  <p class="centeredImage"><img src="digital_day/datalogger1.jpg" alt="Data Loggers" title="Data Loggers" width="119" height="89">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="digital_day/datalogger22.jpg" width="117" height="88" alt="Data Logger" title="Data Logger"></p>
  <p>With the advent of mini laptops, the Science Department have
      invested in USB probes. The student opens up Excel spreadsheet, and clicks
      on Xlogger in the add-ins. Up pops the probe, and the student selects the
      overall sample time and how often the reading is to be taken. With one
    click the Excel programme logs the data and automatically produces the graph,
    which
      can easily and quickly be transferred over into an experiment report being
      written with Microsoft Word on the same mini laptop.</p>
  <p class="centeredImage"><img src="digital_day/graph1.jpg" alt="Excel Graph 1" title="Excel Graph 1" width="211" height="123">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="digital_day/graph2.jpg" width="209" height="123" alt="Excel Graph 2" title="Excel Graph 2"></p>
  
  
  <h4>Lunch</h4>
  <p><strong>Thursday: 1215 - 1255</strong></p>
  <h4>Afternoon Registration/PSHEE</h4>
  <p><strong>Thursday: 1255 &#8211; 1320</strong></p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/ezeschools.jpg" alt="EZESchools" title="EZESchools" width="262" height="181" style="float:right; padding: 5px">Some
    of my Form needed to finish off their Personal Statements and CVs on the
    Personalised Learning Environment (PLE). The contents of the ePortfolio
    will be printed out and placed into a nice new, and shiny, Personal Record
    Of Achievement folder which will be presented to them at their last Honours
    Assembly. This was easily done despite the other Form&#8217;s using the remaining
    ICT rooms. I simply took my mini laptops with me to the Form room at the
    top of another building, and they logged into their PLE page from there.
    The PLE also contains their lesson plans and allows them to look at the lesson
    again if they didn&#8217;t get it first time around.</p>
  
  <h4 class="clear">&#8216;A&#8217; Level Law Lesson (Yr 13)</h4>
  <p><strong>Thursday: 1320 &#8211; 1500</strong></p>
  <p>The Year 13s have finished the syllabus and so they used the mini laptops
    to log on to AQA&#8217;s website and completed the practice examinations
    papers supplied on the site. I had to explain why thirty Year 9 students
    were outside of the classroom window in the sunshine waving temperature and
    light probes around whilst holding a mini laptop in the other hand. Technology
    in action!</p>
  
  <h4>Duty</h4>
  <p><strong>Thursday: 1500 &#8211; 1515</strong></p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/dell_axim_x51v.jpg" width="109" height="147" alt="Dell Axim x51v PDA" title="Dell Axim x51v PDA" style="float:right; padding: 5px">Not an onerous duty after school, so I ran a recording of Prime Minister&#8217;s
    Question Time on my PDA via the BBC News Website.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>activexpression-in hand.jpg</p>
  <h4 class="clear"><a name="training" id="training"></a>ICT CPD Training - ActiveExpression</h4>
  
  <p><strong>Thursday: 1515 &#8211; 1630</strong></p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/activexpressionfront.jpg" alt="ACTIVexpression" title="ACTIVexpression" width="138" height="192" style="float:left; padding: 5px"><img src="digital_day/activexpression.jpg" width="175" height="122" alt="ACTIVexpression in use" title="ACTIVexpression in use" style="float:right; padding: 5px">Used the large ICT suite (explained in the conclusion) to show sixty teachers,
    during an ICT CPD session, how ActiveExpression handsets and software can
    make amazingly interesting and interactive lessons. The general comment from
    all was &#8220;I want one!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Thinking hard of how I can justify even more technology for my little department
    from a budget straining at the edges.</p>
  
  <h4 class="clear">Train to Institute of Education</h4>
  <p><strong>Thursday: 1700</strong></p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/orange_mobile_broadband.jpg" alt="Orange Mobile Broadband dongle" title="Orange Mobile Broadband dongle" width="193" height="96" style="float:left; padding: 5px"><img src="digital_day/hp_mininote_2133.jpg" alt="HP Mini-note 2133" title="HP Mini-note 2133" width="153" height="153" style="float:right; padding: 5px">On
    the train to Liverpool Street Station in London for a two hour assignment
    for my course. Of course, if I was a Luddite,
    I could catch
    some sleep on the way up. But, hey, I am a MirandaNetters so I
      had my HP Mini-note 2133 and Orange Mobile Broadband dongle with me. No
    rest for the wicked, or even ICT Innovation Champions!</p>
  <h4 class="clear"><a name="conclusion" id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>Of course not everything can be done using mini laptops and certainly dedicated
    ICT lessons need their ICT classrooms. Also, the Media Department needs to
    have dedicated machines in dedicated classrooms and suites along with their
    TV and Radio studio. But, as can be seen above, it is now very easy to use
    ICT outside of the dedicated ICT room, reducing the need to convert rooms
    to ICT centres as capacity increases. But gone are the days when the computers
    were benched around the outside of the room or deployed in carousels. Around
    the edge benching meant that the teacher could see the student&#8217;s screens,
    but there was no engagement with people who could not easily see the teacher.
    The carousels offered both, but only for fifty percent of the class at any
    one time. Indeed in my experience, any petty damage to the mouse or the unplugging
    of friends computers were generally done in the rooms where the student couldn&#8217;t
    see their friends or the teacher while sitting around a carousel station.</p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/law_department_mininotes.gif" width="162" height="122" alt="Law Department mini-notes" title="Law Department mini-notes" style="float:right; padding: 5px">Two methods used effectively in my school include
      the use of mini laptops in whatever environment that particular classroom
      provides, conference tabling in my room, and standard desks in other classrooms.
      As has been described already, it is very easy to take a number of mini
    laptops to a classroom and create an instant ICT suite. Obviously, the wireless
    network
      needs to be robust and reliable. As mini laptops are rolled out across
    the school as funding and grants become available this will become more and
    more
      the preferred choice. Indeed, already each Science Department corridor,
    on each floor, now has access to its own LapSafe full of Toshiba mini laptops,
      with the costs of each individual machine plummeting, overtime, with quantity
      discounts.</p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/supercentre.jpg" alt="ICT Super Centre" title="ICT Super Centre" width="158" height="118" style="float:right; padding: 5px">The
    second method involves the &#8216;super&#8217; ICT Centre
      illustrated earlier in this journal. Two rooms opposite each other at the
      end of a corridor have been knocked into one large room, including the
    corridor between them. By terracing the floor, a lecture-hall style room
    is created
      with benching for sixty computers. What on earth can be the advantage of
    that?</p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/teacher_microphone.jpg" alt="Teacher microphone" title="Teacher microphone" width="89" height="68" style="float:left; padding: 5px">The advantages are numerous, but they include, being able to
      have two identical classes in a room together. Why have two Year 10 classes
      working on the same assignment in two separate rooms? Those that need to
      be covered by a Cover Supervisor will be disadvantaged, and the other class
      would get ahead. By having both classes in the same room the ICT teacher
      can do the teaching and the Cover Supervisor or non-specialist teacher
    can help supervise, tour the room offering assistance, and so on.</p>
  <p><img src="digital_day/supercentre_inside.jpg" alt="View of ICT Super Centre" title="View of ICT Super Centre" width="270" height="202" style="float:right; padding: 5px">Equipment is supplied so that everyone can hear and see what
      the ICT teacher is saying and doing. Firstly, the teacher wears a lightweight
      microphone set around his or her neck which is amplified to all parts of
      the room. The rear thirty stations have an additional screen which displays
      whatever the teacher is showing on the SmartBoard, and an additional SmartBoard
    is situated at 90 degrees in the upper half also.</p>
  <p>Separate classes of different Year Groups have also been successfully taught
    in the same room at the same time, although of course this is not ideal but
    is, in any event, rare.</p>
  <p>I hope that readers will find my journal interesting, and I am sure that
    more experienced colleagues than I may see many drawbacks to my Digital Day.
    I look forward to hearing your responses. Now, where can I get a set of ActiveExpression
    handsets?</p>
