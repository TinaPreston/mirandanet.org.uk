  <h2><a name="how"></a>How it began</h2>
  <p> I started working for the European Schoolnet almost one year ago , entrusted 
    with the task of setting up the School Managers Centre (SMC) within the framework 
    of audience based websites (vortals) which are to be found at the European 
    Schoolnet's (EUN) main website. The project is supported by the European Commission 
    under the Socrates-Minerva programme and involves three partners, The European 
    Schoolnet, The City of Helsinki Education Department and the European School 
    Heads Association (ESHA). 
  <p>This was a project in which I was very interested. During my research for 
    the Masters Degree in Information Technology in Education at Trinity College 
    Dublin, I became aware that in all the talk of change with regard to the impact 
    of ICT in the Education in general and schools in particular, head teachers 
    or school principals were a rather neglected group in the whole process despite 
    the fact that research findings were highlighting them as one of the key factors 
    to successful integration. So when offer the opportunity to work on this project 
    I jumped at the opportunity. 
  <h2><a name="dev"></a>The Development of the Idea </h2>
  <p>The focus of the site was laid out, in part, by the dictates of the work 
    programme devised for the project. A website had to be developed for school 
    heads, focussing on ICT in Education.<br>
    So where did I start? I began by asking myself and other school heads what 
    they would want from such a site. I came up with several treads, firstly the 
    need to be informed of change and current and future thinking. Secondly, the 
    statement that the job of principal can be often be a lonely and isolating 
    one where the important issues often become lost in the myriad of everyday 
    challenges that every school principal faces. From these two main ideas the 
    vision of the SMC evolved. I wanted to create a website that would, not only 
    inform school heads of current trends and practices in the area of ICT in 
    education, but would also challenge them to think about the future of school 
    in an eLearning world. I also wished to develop an active community of European 
    School Principals.</p>
  <h2><a name="web"></a>The Building of a Website</h2>
  <p>Armed with the idea, the next stage was to start to design and build the 
    website, a task that took several months. Working with the very talented and 
    committed team which makes up the European Schoolnet the website began to 
    take shape. Firstly there was the design phase where a number of designs were 
    looked at, tested and modified. The idea was to find a design that was clear 
    and attractive at the same time. The logo was designed around an idea I have 
    always held about action in life. Being a proactive and optimistic person, 
    I believe that any action taken in life is like throwing a pebble in a pond; 
    you never know where the ripples will end. So the Logo of the SMC is an echo 
    of this idea.</p>
  <p>When the design was finalised the process of coding the design into templates 
    that could be incorporated into the dynamic database driven main EUN site 
    began. Finally came the task of finding content to fill the pages.</p>
  <p>The current website became operation in September 2001 and functions like 
    a monthly magazine with main articles which change each month. The content 
    is a mixture of articles contributed by school heads and other experts around 
    Europe as well as editorial features. Any person can submit an article for 
    publication and I would welcome any contributions from the MirandaNet community 
    in this regard. The site also contains many interactive features such as instant 
    feedback forms and forms to enable readers to submit articles, news and events 
    at the click of a mouse button.</p>
  <h2><a name="growth"></a>The Growth of a Community</h2>
  <p>The second element of the SMC was to build an online community of school 
    heads across Europe. This task was the greater challenge and it is very interesting 
    to trace the progress of its growth. Since the start of the project I have 
    written a monthly newsletter, which can be subscribed to from the site. This 
    newsletter started in September 2001 with around 50 subscribers. At this point 
    in February 2002 that number is 400+ and growing. In December, two new features 
    were added to the site, a registration facility where school principals could 
    register as European Principals Online, and a new community platform was opened 
    in which school heads could have a more private environment in which to work 
    and discuss. There are now well over 220 school heads registered on the site, 
    and they may be viewed by country. Behind this registration is an active mail 
    list, which school heads use to make professional contacts with each other 
    and also to seek advice from each other.</p>
  <p>The activity within the closed community has been slower up to now, but the 
    movement is towards using the community platform tool is growing. Considering 
    that this group have not, as yet, had any hands on training in using the community 
    tool, this growth is very encouraging. The growth in numbers visiting the 
    site have been very encouraging growing form a monthly average of 22,900 in 
    October 2001 to 102,750 in February 2002.</p>
  <h2><a name="challenges"></a>The Challenges</h2>
  <p>There are several challenges to building a site of this dimension. Multilinguality 
    is a primary one. If the site is to be accessible and used on a European wide 
    basis then the material has to be available in several languages. The site 
    is translated, therefore, into three main languages, English, French and German. 
    Many of the articles are also translated into several other European Languages. 
    In the emerging consciousness of an integrated Europe, the need and indeed 
    the desire to communicate with each other drives this process of providing 
    various language versions of material. Indeed we have witnessed the fact that 
    many of the schools that are involved in the SMC community have gone to the 
    trouble of translating parts of their websites into other languages so they 
    can be more visible to their European visitors. Despite some beliefs to the 
    contrary this strengthens the idea of a collaborative and connected community.</p>
  <h2><a name="future"></a>The Future</h2>
  <p>So what of the future, since work of this nature is not static and constantly 
    needs to be evaluated and revised? As the community using the site becomes 
    more sophisticated in the daily use of ICT, I surmise that their needs in 
    turn will become more sophisticated. As a consequence I anticipate that there 
    will be a need for more interactive features on the site, such as comment 
    boxes and open treaded forums. I would also like to provide advanced communication 
    tools with the possibility of video link up between individual and groups 
    of school heads for instance. A trial version of this will be held during 
    eSchola when on the 24th of April a conference of 50 School Principals in 
    the Netherlands will open to online participation from school heads across 
    Europe, for discussion on various topics. Further information about this will 
    be available on the eSchola website <a href="http://eschola.eun.org/">eschola.eun.org</a></p>
  <p>To continue being a school head in today's world is no mean task, in the 
    light of the complexities in the modern world of education. The teaching profession 
    is becoming an ageing one as it is becoming more difficult to persuade young 
    graduates to turn their backs on the lure of better wages and conditions on 
    offer in the marketplace. Students are becoming more demanding of the quality 
    of what they learn and of what and how they are taught, without always demonstrating 
    the motivation to study that is the other half of success. Principals need 
    to continue to reflect on their job and share their reflections. Through the 
    various services of the EUN and the SMC, the opportunity is provided to all 
    school heads, teachers, students and the wider education community across 
    Europe to inform themselves and contribute to the growing European educational 
    community connect online.</p>
