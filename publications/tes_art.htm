  <h2>Teachers as Innovators<br>
    <small>Christina Preston</small></h2>
  <p>This article is based on new findings from <em>Teachers as Innovators: What 
    motivates teachers to use ICT</em> A study of expert teachers by C. Preston, 
    M. Cox and K. Cox funded by the Teacher Training Agency Special Projects Funding, 
    Compaq and Oracle.</p>
  <p> published in the Times Educational Supplement 10 December (page 21)</p>
  <p>The Government has invested more than one billion pounds in the National 
    Grid for Learning. But what will motivate teachers to use computers well?</p>
  <p>In our study, Teachers as Innovators, funded by the TTA, Oracle and Compaq, 
    we focus on the opinions of about one hundred teachers from a range of subject 
    disciplines who already use ICT in the classroom. The majority who had their 
    own on-line computer and email account, agreed that all teachers and students 
    should have an email address. Yet the average age of these enthusiasts was 
    about 45 and the majority were senior managers, challenging the view that 
    only the younger members of the profession can provide a lead.</p>
  <p>These experts maintained that computers increase pupils' motivation and help 
    them to learn. Several mentioned improved capacity for independent learning, 
    opportunities to vary the learning, improved presentation and increased concentration.</p>
  <p>In terms of professional development, they said that using ICT improved their 
    presentation skills and their range of teaching strategies, promoted diversity 
    and facilitated activities that were otherwise not possible. More resources 
    were accessible and many administrative tasks were easier or faster. Most 
    importantly some felt using ICT in teaching helped them to focus on the processes 
    of learning.</p>
  <p>Despite their competence and confidence, only one teacher had been trained 
    to teach IT initially. Although three-quarters taught ICT to other teachers, 
    approximately 13% had not attended ICT in-service at all; the majority had 
    attended between 3 and 6 basic initial awareness courses and short special 
    courses usually held in school. Most felt that benefits included enhancement 
    of ICT skills, discussions with other professionals and new curriculum ideas. 
    But less than half thought that these courses addressed the central issue 
    of teaching style.</p>
  <p>Even if all teachers are ICT competent by 2002 this will not guarantee that 
    the use of computers develops more independent, relevant and flexible learning 
    models. Teachers need really good mentoring and advice themselves in order 
    to take ownership of this opportunity.</p>
  <p>In our study we tried to identify the special ingredients that create commitment 
    and enthusiasm for new ways of teaching and learning. We found that the Internet 
    may be the application that fires teachers' intellect and imagination.</p>
  <p>Very few had attended on line courses of any kind and half said they did 
    not feel well informed about the National Grid for Learning. But they agreed 
    on the value of sites that provide current information like the educational 
    computing press, the Virtual Teachers' Centre and government agency resources 
    like BECTa.</p>
  <p>About a third belonged to The National Association of Co-ordinators and ICT 
    teachers (ACITT) or the ICT professional development fellowship, MirandaNet.</p>
  <p>Being a member of a professional association including a teachers' on line 
    support network was considered to be important. Half the participants said 
    also they would be willing to spend about 15 hours a month tutoring and supporting 
    colleagues on line.</p>
  <p>The MirandaNet respondents whose on-line community has been developing for 
    five years ago found the communication had enabled them to meet like-minded 
    individuals, to have greater awareness of the uses of ICT, and to keep up 
    with advances in ICT. Some elements of this model, like long term mentoring, 
    publishing case studies for peers, industry partnership and contact with teachers 
    outside the UK may be helpful to other professional groups who want to set 
    up similar on-line communities.</p>
