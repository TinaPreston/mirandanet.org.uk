  <p>‘You can’t use technology – you teach PE.’</p>
  <p>How often has the above phrase or something similar been bantered about the 
    staffroom? I used to hear such comments a number of years ago but not anymore. 
    Nowadays more often than not colleagues are asking for advice on how to use 
    this piece of equipment or how did you do that. The 21<sup>st</sup> century 
    has arrived and ICT can play an interesting and innovative role in the teaching 
    of physical education.</p>
  <p>World-class athletes are analysed, measured, recorded and trained. The most 
    advanced technologies are implemented to provide the best environment for 
    competition, for training and for performance. How many school pupils – who 
    are the athletes of the future – any of this technology? How many PE teachers 
    assume their department will be the last to receive NOF funding? How many 
    PE teachers declare ‘it will take up to much practical time’ or ‘we will not 
    be able to buy that equipment, we need a new set of gym mats’?</p>
  <p>During my 14 years teaching I have heard most of the excuses and many of 
    the moans. However, I always strive to use technology in which ever way I 
    can. One of my first experiences of trying to be interactive involved taking 
    a laptop out onto the track with the group in order for pupils to record their 
    results straight into the results programme. We could not see the screen (a 
    rare sunny day) and within 5 minutes the battery had expired and I was looking 
    around for scraps of paper and a pencil.</p>
  <p>In the last year I have been given a new lease of life; a breath of fresh 
    air. I was awarded a MirandaNet scholarship, sponsored by Oracle. This has 
    provided me with access to like-minded colleagues who are dedicated to developing 
    the use of ICT in the classroom or in the case of physical education, the 
    sportshall, gym or field in addition to the classroom. My colleagues in school 
    have supported my drive towards implementing various projects and through 
    Oracle we have been privileged to experiment with different pieces of equipment.</p>
  <p>The digital camera has made a huge impact in many areas of the curriculum 
    – many faculties have since budgeted for their own. GCSE pupils have taken 
    jpeg images of their performance and used the images in support of the analytical 
    aspect of their coursework. They have used the mpeg facility to record 5 – 
    10 seconds activity, then critically analyse their own and others performance, 
    identifying targets and awarding praise. We have used the camera images to 
    provide a visual image to key words which supports the school literacy policy.</p>
  <p>The use of video is often used in PE, but how often have you seen a class 
    of 28 pupils crouched around a small TV propped up in the gym? I have tried 
    and felt very frustrated. The projector I now use allows me to play through 
    the linked video any image, and any size onto any space. You do not need to 
    have a screen – the changing rooms in my school are a cream colour – the pupils 
    can all see and 5 minutes of carefully chosen footage can provide the inspiration 
    for the lesson. Or perhaps in the middle of the lesson to introduce a new 
    aspect of the skill involved – slow motion action shots of top class performance 
    provide all the imagery needed. Television coverage of most sports today is 
    excellent and can be used effectively. Do we assume too much? Take a Year 
    7 girl in her first shot putt lesson – has she any idea about shot putt? Does 
    she have a visual image of what she is trying to do? – I suspect NOT. With 
    video input we can provide that image and give the lesson a context and hopefully 
    relevance.</p>
  <p>Classroom lessons have changed since I started using an interactive smart 
    board linked to a laptop. Projecting the computer screen onto a full size 
    board has allowed all pupils in the group to see and respond to the various 
    CD-ROMs used to support the theoretical side of the curriculum. Being able 
    to make the screen change by touching it instead of using the mouse has revitalised 
    some of the lessons. Pupils have been lining up to answer questions, eager 
    to try and their retention of the skills taught has been excellent. Used alongside 
    my established programmes of study I feel I am providing a more informative 
    and interesting education.</p>
  <p>What type of pupils do I teach? The school A-C rate is going up – we achieved 
    32% this year. We have 35 % free school meals and many of the pupils have 
    very limited access to ICT equipment. The school will be fully networked within 
    a few weeks and that alone will lend itself to many more interactive possibilities. 
    There have been many frustrations – my present teaching room is not secure 
    at the moment and we cannot risk setting up the interactive board until it 
    is. My constant demand for floppy disks and CD-ROMs has meant my Head of Department 
    has had to include them in the department budget. And TIME, there is never 
    enough time, juggling teaching and marking with running extra curricular activities, 
    being a Head of Year and other hidden time constraints has been the biggest 
    problem – one I strive to overcome because I feel I have had a new lease of 
    life. I love it, I enjoy using technology and embracing new approaches wherever 
    possible. There are times when a pure practical lesson is paramount to the 
    harmonious development of the skills taught. Technology in the wrong place 
    at the wrong time can be a hindrance. As in many physical education lessons 
    it all comes down to balance. Technology is not ‘The Answer’ but it is an 
    interesting and innovative way to approach the future and whether we like 
    it or not the 21<sup>st</sup> century is here and we can go forward with our 
    colleagues of bury our heads in the long jump pit.</p>
