  <h3>Teacher Involvement in Innovations using ICT</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Teachers want to give their learners a greater sense of autonomy and responsibility 
      for learning, and are very willing to challenge a narrow transmissive model 
      of teaching and learning</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There is strong evidence emerging from the project that many teachers are 
    able to make changes to their classroom practice through their involvement 
    with the project. Teachers&#8217; motivations for getting involved with the 
    project are multiple and complex but many are wanting to find ways to move 
    beyond a narrow focus on transmissive models of pedagogy and want to harness 
    the power of technology to change the way that their particular subject is 
    taught. Many want to foster a greater sense of autonomy and responsibility 
    for learning within their pupils and allow them to make creative choices about 
    how to learn a particular topic. The PELRS framework, with a plenary consultation 
    with the pupils at the beginning of a learning event, has proved effective 
    in allowing teachers to retain control of the curriculum content while pupils 
    have real choices of resources and methods of learning that content.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>PELRS provides an alternative to the traditional linear lesson plan and 
      so gives teachers a new way of thinking about how to use ICT across the 
      curriculum</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The PELRS framework and pedagogic strategies have worked well to give teachers 
    an alternative to the linear lesson plan and style of lesson planning which 
    constructs teachers and pupils in mutually exclusive relationships of teacher 
    and taught, and where ICT resources are controlled by the teacher and planned 
    into the learning process in discrete and limited ways. The PELRS alternative 
    to lesson planning in the linear mode gives teachers access to a variety of 
    conceptual and planning tools which enable them to think about teaching and 
    learning in broader terms, for instance in the ways in which roles in the 
    classroom can be negotiated or where technology might be used as a resource.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A focus on redefining roles within the classroom, so for instance learners 
      can take the role of teacher on for a specific issue, or the teacher can 
      be recast as a learner is a powerful way to &#8216;interrupt&#8217; traditional 
      school practices and foster more creative ways of working using ICT</li>
  </ul>
  <p>PELRS was designed in part to address the problem that many teachers are 
    reluctant to use innovative processes with ICT in their classroom because 
    of a lack of complete technical mastery. This assumption of the need to display 
    superior competence, borne of the teacher&#8217;s traditional role as source 
    of knowledge, has acted in the past as a strong barrier to development, as 
    many of these teachers lack the time to gain all of the skills needed before 
    they feel confident allowing a group to use a particular technology. The PELRS 
    framework offers potential solutions to this dilemma. Groups of pupils can 
    work independently to gain the expertise in a particular technique or software 
    package and then share that with peers and with the teacher. There is much 
    evidence that the explicit attention PELRS gives to re-defining roles within 
    the classroom frees teachers from the pressure to show they have total expertise 
    on every aspect of a technology and allows pools of expertise to be created 
    within the classroom and shared across groups rather than all of the technical 
    skills being mediated through the agency of the teacher.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Changes to classroom practice require teachers to have opportunities to 
      engage with theoretical material on teaching and learning and to challenge 
      some of the orthodoxies which can stifle creative pedagogic engagements</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A key aim of the PELRS project was to use learning theory, particularly activity 
    theory and sociocultural theory, to give teachers opportunities to engage 
    with ways of thinking about how they could use ICT within the curriculum. 
    The PELRS framework, with its graphical depiction of learning theory and practical 
    advice about how to structure learning events gives teachers access to new 
    ways of thinking about teaching and learning. There is evidence that a certain 
    kind of &#8220;orthodox&#8221; approach to thinking about pedagogy (in terms 
    of whole class teaching and aims and outcomes delivered within a single lesson 
    unit) has stifled debates about the multiple and contested ways in which learning 
    can happen, even within a school context. The PELRS framework is one way in 
    which this debate can be reopened, and because teachers are able to relate 
    to the theories embedded in the framework and see them being operationalised 
    in their classroom &#8211; whilst also being challenged by some of the framework&#8217;s 
    more radical features &#8211; it can act effectively as a way of changing 
    how teachers conceive of teaching and learning.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The project has demonstrated that pupils can take on more responsibility 
      for controlling their own learning and also meet curriculum requirements</li>
  </ul>
  <p>PELRS has been challenging the notion of fixed roles of teachers, pupils 
    and others within the learning sphere and attempting to show that these roles 
    are not given or fixed, but can be negotiated and placed in creative tension 
    in order to find new ways of working. Certain of the PELRS strategies, particularly 
    the &#8220;pupils as teachers&#8221; strategy embed this change of role into 
    the activity itself. Evidence from activities undertaken have shown that pupils 
    welcome the chance to take responsibility for their own learning and that 
    structured group work with opportunities for collaboration on joint ICT led 
    presentation projects is effective both in helping learners take control of 
    their learning, and in helping them to acquire the curriculum content stipulated 
    by the teacher.</p>
  <h3> Pupil Knowledge and Skills</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Success in using ICT across the curriculum is based on recognising the 
      skills and knowledge which pupils may already possess</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A key focus of the PELRS project has been on using the skills and knowledge 
    which many pupils gain whilst working on computers outside of school contexts 
    and drawing these back into the activity system of the school. Through the 
    planning of activities using ICT which are open-ended, and where real creative 
    choices are placed in the hands of the pupil, PELRS is demonstrating that 
    teachers and pupils can come to an agreement about the objective of a learning 
    event and use technology to create a motivational atmosphere to achieve that 
    objective. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The sharing of expertise and skills between pupils is a feature of PERLS 
      allowing knowledge to be shared by peers rather than always controlled by 
      the teacher.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Pupils working with PELRS report that they are motivated by tasks which allow 
    them to use ICT in open-ended ways and where an emphasis on performance and 
    outcome is favoured over the teaching of a particular or discrete set of skills. 
    Opportunities for peer coaching and the sharing of expertise from pupil to 
    pupil are greatly enhanced during PELRS work (when measured against lessons 
    where access to ICT is controlled in a traditional way), and teachers report 
    this as being effective in helping all pupils achieve high quality work. The 
    need for the discrete teaching of skills, whilst not removed completely by 
    this approach, is reduced within the PELRS framework as pupils can gain skills 
    on a &#8220;need to use&#8221; basis and teachers can modify and control groupings 
    to optimise the sharing of skills. In primary schools the use of teaching 
    assistants can greatly enhance this process. Many of these are rapidly becoming 
    experts in the support of pupil learning using ICT and the third year work 
    is already creating case studies of the ways in which teachers and classroom 
    assistants can collaborate on projects.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Capturing learners&#8217; imagination is done through open-ended activities 
      using ICT and where they can experience the sense of &#8220;flow&#8221; 
      involved in being completely immersed in a task.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The success of pupil learning using ICT can be judged by the occurrence of 
    &#8220;flow&#8221;, that is a state of mental activity where the mind is taken 
    up completely with the task in hand. We have very strong evidence that PELRS 
    learning events are much more likely to lead to flow than lessons based on 
    traditional pedagogy. Many PELRS learning events have captured the imagination 
    of pupils and, because of the open-ended nature of the activities, the pupils 
    have been able to work on the material away from the formal classroom situation. 
    Teachers may appear initially reluctant to set work which relies on access 
    to hardware, software or internet connections outside school because of equity 
    issues, but the use of groups within PELRS has gone some way to solving this 
    issue and many pupils are now working independently on projects using resources 
    they have at home and in other settings.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The knowledge and skills which pupils can display during innovative curriculum 
      projects with ICT is often not credited by current assessment systems.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We found during the project that as pupils worked collaboratively on projects, 
    sharing not just knowledge of curriculum content but also skills in using 
    ICT that many positive outcomes, such as working in groups, taking control 
    of learning, negotiating timescales and engaging in metacognition, were not 
    capable of being credited in the assessment system. The teachers were well 
    aware of the positive nature of these outcomes and committed to further work 
    to embed these in classroom practice, but the rather narrow nature of the 
    formal assessment regime, centred as it is on individual performance, renders 
    this important work &#8220;invisible&#8221;. The PELRS project has shown that 
    new ways of teaching require new ways of assessing learning and in the current 
    climate further innovations could be hampered by the system.</p>
  <h3>School Infrastructure</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>More systematic investment in new infrastructure and digital tools such 
      as cameras is rapidly increasing schools&#8217; potential to do innovative 
      work with ICT across the curriculum</li>
  </ul>
  <p>During the lifetime of the project, the infrastructure for learning with 
    ICT in schools has generally been improving. Work with a number of schools 
    in this third year of the project has allowed us to see ICT provision in a 
    far wider range of settings and compare this with the provision in the four 
    partner schools we worked with in years one and two. Wireless networking using 
    suites of laptops is becoming popular, in both primary and secondary schools, 
    and many machines have been recently replaced and are state of the art. There 
    is evidence that many schools are beginning to invest more systematically 
    in digital tools such as video cameras, still cameras, digital microscopes 
    etc., This investment is extending the potential for innovative work within 
    the classroom and a project such as PELRS can be instrumental in allowing 
    teachers to find a space to use the new technology. Formal ICT lessons are 
    less likely to give teachers a model of how to use a new technology in their 
    practice because of the nature of lesson planning and delivery in this mode, 
    but PELRS offers the use of smaller groups exploring new equipment and techniques 
    and therefore a way of embedding the technology more effectively into the 
    work of the classroom. Strategies such as the &#8220;pupils as teachers&#8221; 
    and &#8220;pupils as producers of media&#8221; also give the opportunity for 
    whole class sharing of work and therefore chances for pupil groups to interact 
    with a whole class and a sense of shared objectives to emerge. As these &#8220;plenary&#8221; 
    events are more about the input from the pupils rather than being wholly teacher 
    directed, pupils find them engaging and motivating and work hard to produce 
    the best possible outputs for these.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The introduction of interactive whiteboards into schools is increasing 
      the visible use of ICT but a strategy to involve pupils in the use of the 
      technology is needed in addition</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The ongoing investment in interactive white boards is to be welcomed, but 
    there is a danger that this technology reinforces rather than disrupts the 
    dominance of traditional pedagogies. PELRS has sought to use the interactive 
    white boards within learning events so that pupils as well as teachers can 
    plan and deliver lessons using the boards and rather than the tool being solely 
    for the teacher&#8217;s use, there is a sense that it is a shared resource 
    in the classroom.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access to the internet and school policies can sometimes have a detrimental 
      affect on teaching and learning and the need to support pupils must be balanced 
      against the incredible power of the internet to transform learning in schools</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In many schools, the administration of the computer network, and in particular 
    access to the internet is hampering attempts to widen the nature of the teaching 
    and learning process. Aggressive internet filters serve the purpose of giving 
    the school protection from pupils who may access inappropriate material (either 
    accidentally or by choice), but in many cases the filters are too strong and 
    serve to block access to sites which could be legitimately used for learning. 
    Pupils often need access to the full power of the internet, rather than an 
    artificially controlled subset of resources and where this is happening, the 
    potential for transformation is much higher than in schools where the internet 
    is perhaps controlled too tightly. There is a real opportunity for schools 
    to teach more explicitly about web searching, how to judge web-site sources 
    and responsible internet use. Rather than using software and hardware solutions 
    which move the responsibility away from pupils and invest it in technical 
    arrangements, there needs to be education on what to do when pupils accidentally 
    access inappropriate material. There is also scope for better education of 
    parents, possibly including the signing of home-school agreements where parents 
    acknowledge that total policing of the internet is not a possibility and where 
    the schools are to some extent protected from legal challenges if inappropriate 
    material is accessed. Evidence from the project suggests that the accessing 
    of inappropriate material may actually be very rare in schools (through either 
    the deliberate or accidental actions of pupils), and that schools may have 
    become too defensive on this topic because of the fear of media involvement.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In some cases innovative work places demands on school ICT infrastructures, 
      giving rise to problems that may require expert help despite teachers growing 
      technical competence. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Many PELRS activities place demands on a school infrastructure which are 
    not normally made by traditional learning activities. For instance multiple 
    groups may be working with still or video images and require access to editing 
    software and the necessary network resources to move this data around. Teachers 
    have been creative in seeking solutions to these challenges but many also 
    report that they need more help in solving these particular issues and in 
    some cases a fundamental rethink of the way the school approaches its network 
    may be needed.</p>
  <p>PELRS style work requires that pupils have control over their data and are 
    able to save, open and access files on a long term basis. Some schools, through 
    the provision of network space, have gone a long way to making this a reality 
    and giving pupils the resources needed to direct and control their independent 
    work using ICT. In other schools, the network is limiting rather than extending 
    the pupils&#8217; potential and this issue needs to addressed at a school 
    level by the relevant managers and leaders.</p>
