  <p><strong>The Ruffwood @ Home Project</strong><br>
    Ruffwood School have loaned 100 brand new computers and printers to students 
    and their families living in the Northwood neighbourhood of Kirkby. In the 
    near future they will also receive a web camera and free Internet access via 
    Knowsley Council's network. The project will research the impact of ICT on 
    student performance, development and family and community learning and regeneration. 
  </p>
  <p><strong>In Partnership with:</strong><br>
    Northwood SRB, Telewest Communications and Knowsley MBC. Northwood is a high 
    priority area for regeneration, hence its Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) 
    status. It scores very badly on most counts of social deprivation including 
    low GCSE results and high youth unemployment. </p>
  <p><strong>Ruffwood School</strong><br>
    The school has a progressive vision and an excellent record of technology 
    innovation and social inclusion. Ruffwood @ Home is one example of how the 
    school believes ICT can advance the learning of our students, and at the same 
    time, tackle equal opportunities to technology. The project is managed in 
    the school and match funding and expertise is also provided. </p>
  <p><strong>Benefitting Students</strong><br>
    Computers have been in the homes since August 2001. Since that time many students 
    have reported improvements to their homework grades and ICT skills and some 
    are showing an increased motivation to work. One student has carer responsibilities 
    and is excited about being able to videoconference with his friends from home. 
  </p>
  <p>Students are being encouraged to shape the project themselves: from designing 
    the project's web site, to embarking on Young Enterprise initiatives surrounding 
    ICT. They are also given the opportunity to express their lives via a web 
    site and digital filming ideas. Students are continually asked about their 
    feelings and ideas concerning the project, and about their general learning 
    needs.</p>
  <p><strong>Working with ICT in the Classroom</strong><br>
    Students are expected to use ICT in the classroom more and more. The project 
    will embrace ICT systems and packages, which support curriculum activities. 
    Students on the project will have access from the home to the 'Knowsley Learning 
    Place'; the local authority's education intranet, designed to support classroom 
    and curriculum activities. Communication will also be improved once homework 
    and messages can be emailed to students and parents. </p>
  <p><strong>Bringing ICT to the Home</strong><br>
    More importantly, the equipment is a bridge between school and the home: improving 
    relationships and frequency of communication. We will provide all parents 
    will an e-mail address, which logs onto the school network. There are also 
    parents involved with the project; helping with research and organising events. 
    Each home now has evidence of the efforts the school is making to aid their 
    child's education. </p>
  <p><strong>Encouraging Family Learning</strong><br>
    Having a computer in the home is bringing a two-way learning process, with 
    students helping parents and parents helping students. For students, the opportunity 
    to teach has been rewarding and empowering, for adults it has allowed greater 
    knowledge of their child's progress at school. This project will help parents 
    to support their children and share their child's learning experiences.</p>
  <p><strong>Improving Homework and Exam Results</strong><br>
    The personal touch of the project is to encourage and inspire students to 
    try their best when it comes to school and to take their efforts and achievements 
    seriously. The computers can make homework easier and more exciting. Ultimately 
    we hope this will increase the percentage of GCSE grades obtained at C and 
    above. This is one way the project will be monitored.</p>
  <p><strong>Mentor and E-mentor Support</strong><br>
    Personal mentors will be recruited from the local business, residential and/or 
    school community, to support students on the project. Many students have expressed 
    a preference for an e-mentor, recruited from a variety of professions, who 
    may support and advise them about their career aspirations or hobbies. An 
    e-mentor has no geographical boundaries, and makes communication less time 
    consuming and easier. It is hoped therefore, that the highest calibre of e-mentor 
    will communicate with our students, matched to suit their needs. Students 
    will also act as mentors to their own parents and other family members.</p>
  <p><strong>Benefitting the Family</strong><br>
    A Community Skills Co-ordinator has recently been recruited to the project 
    to develop the skills of adult family members. Bespoke training/learning packages 
    are being designed for the individual to suit their needs, which may include 
    home-based lessons on the computer. The student focus approach and the adult 
    focus approach will then be merged to form the family approach. Great things 
    are expected from this project and ICT shall play a pivotal role in its success. 
  </p>
  <p>There are many ways computers can benefit the family. Added entertainment 
    has become apparent, improvements in schoolwork, increased employability through 
    improved ICT skills, increased communication abilities and provision, friendship 
    formations and general knowledge expansion. The computer is a luxury that 
    many people cannot afford, but by having one in the household, more doors 
    are opened to the technological present that we exist in and the future that 
    lies ahead. </p>
  <p>Ruffwood School is a community school and provides education and training 
    opportunities to the adult population of Northwood as well as its children. 
    Computer courses for parents are available at Ruffwood School.</p>
  <p><strong>Benefitting the Community</strong><br>
    Apart from benefiting the family, the project automatically stretches itself 
    to benefit the community. In fact, the Ruffwood @ Home project is already 
    becoming a community of users. With the help of web cameras and Internet based 
    communication, we expect greater communication between the community and a 
    sense of ownership in their own development. </p>
  <p>Project staff are continually linking up with related organisations in order 
    to share ideas, collaborate and build partnerships. Please contact the project 
    staff for more information.</p>
