  <blockquote> <strong>Abstract</strong>: <br>
    Because of their learning difficulties, dyslexic children are often looked 
    upon as being the lowest common denominator on the academic scale, or even 
    regarded as problem students. Using traditional methodologies and new technologies, 
    this project allowed students with specific learning difficulties to utilise, 
    examine, explore, plan and design new thematic programmes which permitted 
    them to go beyond the apparent barriers of the 'chalk and talk' classroom 
    to experience the joy of learning and explore avenues of thought. The results 
    of their work are now benefiting all students, and teachers, at all levels 
    as the lowest common denominator has become the highest productive factor. 
    One such child is Tom. His case study epitomises the path this journey has 
    taken and together with his story, the programmes which eventually resulted 
    from all our experiences. </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Introduction</strong> <br>
    In 1999, as co-ordinator of a locally-based national Schools Integrated Project 
    in Technology (SIP) concerning the development of oral and aural language 
    skills at the primary (elementary) level in Ireland, it became apparent to 
    the author that traditional methods of utilising and reinforcing language 
    acquisition skills were failing to meet the needs of specific groups of children, 
    especially in a bilingual (Gaelic/English) school environment. In a variety 
    of schools, there were obviously highly motivated and intelligent students 
    who seemed incapable of absorbing the information being presented to them, 
    albeit by excellent teachers employing a variety of non-technological methodologies, 
    and teaching styles. </p>
  <p>Investigating the source of the barriers to learning with the students themselves, 
    their parents, and their teachers, the author discovered that a significant 
    number of them had been previously diagnosed by developmental and educational 
    psychologists as being numerical and/or literary dyslexics with above average 
    IQ. It was only on discovering this, that the possibility of exploring, understanding 
    and incorporating more effective learning strategies in language/second language 
    acquisition presented themselves. An old Irish saying tells us that God never 
    closes one door without opening another. In the case of these dyslexic children, 
    all we had to do was allow them to give us the keys to enter and perceive 
    their realm of thought and learning to begin more effective communication. 
  </p>
  <p>Our project, SIP 056, was entitled &quot;The Development of Oral and Aural 
    Language Skills at Infant and Remedial Levels in Primary Schools, in both 
    Irish and English, through the Medium of Full Multimedia Programmes and ICT, 
    within the Guidelines of the Revised Irish Primary School Curriculum&quot;. 
    (The term &quot;Remedial Levels&quot; refers to Learning Support.) The project 
    undertook the task of addressing these challenges and present both teachers 
    and students, with a potential blueprint for the development of language usage. 
    It was conceived that it might also open up avenues of practical applications 
    for in-service education. Allied with this was the co-ordinator's belief that 
    technology-enhanced language learning could be more fully utilised to increase 
    the possibilities of this project. </p>
  <p><strong>Tom's Story</strong> <br>
    Tom came to our Gaelscoil (All-Gaelic, Bi-Lingual Primary School), at the 
    age of five years, having already attended another elementary school. In consultation 
    with his parents, he was referred for assessment, because of concerns over 
    reading and language difficulties. Tom's cognitive functioning was assessed 
    using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children lll UK, which yielded the 
    following profile: </p>
  <p><strong>Cognitive Ability</strong> <br>
  </p>
  <table border="1" align="center">
    <tr> 
      <td>Verbal Intelligence Quotient</td>
      <td>126 Centile 96</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>Performance Intelligence Quotient</td>
      <td>116 Centile 86</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>Full Scale Intelligence Quotient</td>
      <td>125 Centile 95</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p> <strong>Table 1:</strong> Tom's overall Cognitive Scores for the <em>Wechsler 
    Intelligence Scale for Children lll </em></p>
  <p>Strengths in Tom's cognitive profile related to exceptionally high performance 
    in Comprehension, Vocabulary and Similarities Subtests. This suggested exceptionally 
    high ability in verbal fluency, word knowledge, word usage, social comprehension, 
    and logical thinking and reasoning. An exceptionally high performance was 
    also recorded for the Picture Arrangement Subtest, which suggested particular 
    strength in visual perception and the ability to plan ahead. In contrast, 
    difficulties were experienced in the Arithmetic and Object Assembly Subtests, 
    which were a measure of numerical accuracy, reasoning and mental arithmetic. 
    Low scores suggested inadequate memory and poorly consolidated reasoning skills. 
  </p>
  <p><strong>Literacy Skills </strong><br>
    Assessment using the Wechsler Objective Reading Dimension Test, yielded the 
    following profile: <br>
  </p>
  <table border="1" align="center">
    <tr> 
      <td>Test</td>
      <td><strong>Predicted Score</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Difference</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Significance</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Frequency</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>Basic Reading</td>
      <td>115</td>
      <td>34</td>
      <td>P=0.01</td>
      <td>&lt;1%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>Spelling</td>
      <td>113</td>
      <td>29</td>
      <td>P=0.01</td>
      <td>&lt;1%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>Reading Comprehension</td>
      <td>117</td>
      <td>45</td>
      <td>P=0.01</td>
      <td>&lt;1%</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><strong>Table 2:</strong> Tom's overall Literacy Skills Scores for the <em>Wechsler 
    Objective Reading Dimension Test </em></p>
  <p>The above profile suggested that Tom's degree of under-achievement was statistically 
    significant and that he had a specific and severe disability in relation to 
    reading, spelling and reading comprehension. The subtests also indicated difficulties 
    in identifying and distinguishing rhyming pairs in word strings and delays 
    in processing numbers. It was further discovered that Tom's learning style 
    preference was towards a Kinaesthetic and Accommodative Learning Style (Harthill 
    and Busch, 1998). This led us to examine and explore areas of practical experience 
    in understanding the various learning styles in second language classrooms 
    both as in-service and on-line processes to more fully accommodate all students 
    in language assimilation. </p>
  <p>In summary, Tom presented with a significant and severe learning disability 
    (i.e. dyslexia/specific literary difficulties) in relation to basic reading, 
    spelling, reading comprehension, number reasoning, and number operations. 
    The nature of his difficulties related to visual memory and sound processing. 
  </p>
  <p>When his participation in the programme was proposed and explained to him, 
    his immediate response was; &quot;Don't ask me to do this, M&aacute;istir 
    (the students' Gaelic term for Principal). I know I'm no good at remembering 
    words and doing things like that. The others are better.&quot; Tom's words 
    would seem to typify the dyslexic's attitude to school and learning which 
    McDermott argues is a natural by-product of the &quot;schooling system (which) 
    is inherently competitive&#133;. the inevitability of failure is built into 
    the system&#133;By the normal line of reasoning, the child is the unit of 
    analysis and the (learning) disability is a mishap that scars a child's road 
    to competence&quot;, (1993: 237). </p>
  <p><strong>The Study</strong> <br>
    The original idea for this project, SIP056, came as a natural development 
    from the experiences of the principal of a Gaelscoil, an all-gaelic primary 
    school, in the areas of language usage and development, and information communication 
    technology. It has long been recognised that the Irish language in particular 
    has failed to catch the imagination of students and teachers. One could go 
    as far as saying that most students dislike having to study Irish because 
    the methodology behind its teaching has failed to keep pace with modern language 
    learning strategies. This also could be true of the methodology behind the 
    development of language usage in English and in bilingual and multilingual 
    settings (Nunan, 1988, 1989). </p>
  <p>Within the guidelines of the Revised Irish Curriculum, particularly in the 
    areas of the development of the Irish and English languages, it is proposed 
    that teachers would embrace a new perspective in, </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><em>&quot;Promoting positive attitudes and developing an appreciation of 
      the value of language -- creating, fostering and maintaining the child's 
      interest in expression and communication -- developing confidence and competence 
      in listening, speaking, reading and writing -- enhancing emotional, imaginative 
      and aesthetic development through oral reading and writing experiences&quot;. 
      </em></p>
    (Curaclam na Bunscoile, NCCA, 1999. English Language. Pp. 10-12; Curaclam 
    na Bunscoile, Gaeilge, Teanga. Pp. 14-15). </blockquote>
  <p>Our project interpreted these curricular guidelines in a very simple way 
    -- making language learning fun. We believed that through the identification 
    of key words in the Irish and English languages, integrated into a thematic 
    visual arts programme -- drama -- we could encourage children to develop confidence 
    and competence in language usage. Not alone that, but by encouraging them 
    to use ICT (digital cameras, scanners, video cameras and multimedia programmes), 
    we would place at their disposal a multitude of potential learning experiences, 
    which would systematically lead them along the path of language acquisition 
    and familiarisation. We also believed that if we succeeded with what may be 
    considered to be the lowest common denominator in our schools, (kids like 
    Tom), from a language development perspective, then the project would naturally 
    extend to all other students. </p>
  <p>There have been some memorable milestones in our project to date, one of 
    which was the identification and compilation of the key words used in Gaelic 
    and English in the development of language skills. We examined, from a learning 
    support perspective, the Dolch lists of words and in consultation with Tom, 
    our staffs and other educational bodies, we supplemented these lists to include 
    more modern words. We then divided all of these lists and words into both 
    class and age group categories. From a Gaelic perspective, we looked at the 
    work carried out in the early 1960s in the identification of the key words 
    in the spoken language and, following a similar pattern of research, we compiled 
    a comprehensive and yet not exhaustive wordlist. The project schools and others 
    then tested these lists, to verify their appropriateness to age and class 
    grouping, and their feedback allowed us to consolidate them. These lists are 
    available for downloading at <a href="http://www.gaelscoil.com/site2002">www.gaelscoil.com/site2002 
    </a></p>
  <p>Following that, we decided to design a full and inclusive, whole school programme 
    in drama and phonetics, using the wordlists. The programmes in Gaelic and 
    English, encompassed the various levels already recognised, allowing us to 
    introduce language learning, in a fun and novel way, through the medium of 
    eight themes which Tom and the other students had identified. These themes 
    were: </p>
  <p>Junior Infants - (4-5 years) - Our homes and families / &Aacute;r dtithe 
    agus &aacute;r dteaghlaigh<br>
    Senior Infants - (5-6 years) - People in our community / Daoine in &aacute;r 
    bPobal<br>
    First Class - (6-7 years) - Nature all around us/ An N&aacute;d&uacute;r, 
    thart timpeall orainn<br>
    Second Class - (7-8 years) - Our school / &Aacute;r scoil<br>
    Third Class - (8-9 years) - Lots to do/ Ruda&iacute; le d&eacute;anamh<br>
    Fourth Class - (9-10 years) - Customs and traditions / Custaim agus Traidisi&uacute;n<br>
    Fifth Class - (10-11 years) - Local history/ Stair in &aacute;r dtimpeall<br>
    Sixth Class - (11-12 years) - Local industry and commerce / Domhan &aacute;iti&uacute;il 
    tionscail agus gn&oacute;lachta&iacute;. </p>
  <p>Using these themes, the wordlists, and the drama and phonetic schemes, we 
    implemented the programme of language development and usage, in the hope that 
    the children would use their experiences to transfer their thoughts and their 
    ideas into computer-generated, multimedia programmes in the quest for creative 
    technology-enhanced language learning. </p>
  <p>Microsoft PowerPoint was chosen as the medium. In essence, we the teachers, 
    in partnership with the students and parents, sent Tom and his fellow students 
    out into the environment to research these various themes: to take digital 
    images, to build story lines around them, to present them in the drama class 
    and develop the whole concept, so that their experiences could be integrated 
    with the curricular aims and objectives of the Revised Curriculum in both 
    Gaelic and English. </p>
  <p>In the infant classes, the teachers introduced the word lists in a phased 
    manner using the drama programme as the medium of expression. In the learning 
    support classes, already having experienced the words in their drama schedule, 
    the children were introduced to the various word and phonetic lists in a more 
    formal and focused manner. The themes mentioned above were always utilised 
    to help the children to focus on the possibilities of word usage. This was 
    a very challenging task as the ability and age range of the students in question 
    varied greatly, but in small group situations, the teachers were able to elicit 
    responses from them without the students being under too much pressure. This 
    proved to be very effective, and the teachers noticed that the responses of 
    the students who were attending learning support were very positive in class. 
  </p>
  <p>The development of the programme has not been without its problems, as the 
    old saying goes, &quot;Is fada an bh&oacute;thar gan casadh -- It is a long 
    road, which has no turns&quot;. The fact that many of the teachers had not 
    experienced any formal training in the use of ICT and multimedia presentations 
    meant that a detailed, logical and sequential programme had to be designed 
    by the author to ensure that they were equipped with the necessary skills 
    to develop and implement the project. The provision of substitute cover by 
    the Department of Education and Science for the teachers involved facilitated 
    the implementation of the training programme and the project in general. </p>
  <p>Because of the extension of the programme to a selection of pilot project 
    schools (small rural to large urban), it was occasionally more difficult for 
    the smaller schools to find time to implement the project. This was due to 
    the fact that some schools were sharing learning support teachers and in some 
    cases, the same teacher was teaching multiple class groupings. At times this 
    was found to be an advantage, as older children were able to mentor younger 
    children, and peer to peer teaching was seen to be very effective, as the 
    teacher was afforded the time to be a more creative support. </p>
  <p>In summary, all the above has entailed many, many hours of research, evaluation, 
    implementation, assessment, redesign and re-implementation of the various 
    strands of the project. Moreover, the challenge of identifying the learning 
    styles of the children with learning disabilities, which &quot;&quot;refers 
    to a person's general approach to learning and problem-solving&quot; (Reid 
    1995), and observing their learning strategies, which are &quot;any specific 
    conscious action or behaviour a student takes to improve learning&quot; (Oxford 
    and Nam 1998) dictated the manner in which the project evolved. </p>
  <p><strong>What Has Been the Impact on Teaching and Learning?</strong> <br>
    This project caught the imagination of the parents involved as they willingly 
    offered their services to help with its implementation. This ranged from studying 
    various words and themes with the children, to providing advice on the possibilities 
    of implementing the chosen themes of the project and understanding their children's 
    learning styles. With this came a sense of true partnership in education. 
  </p>
  <p>The manner in which the aims and objectives of the Revised Curriculum, with 
    reference to the development of language skills, has been implemented in the 
    schools, is undoubtedly one of the major impacts of our project on teaching 
    and learning. The use of technology and multimedia has become a natural ally 
    in designing programmes, which are student-driven, and therefore more interesting 
    to them. The teachers, on the other hand, having seen the benefits to the 
    students, naturally adapted their learning and teaching styles to the advantage 
    of the children. So both the academic requirements of the Revised Curriculum 
    and the fun aspects of language learning have been successfully fused together. 
  </p>
  <p>Tom and many of the other children attending learning support, have developed 
    their own personal programmes using the words which they themselves felt most 
    comfortable with and we believe that this is one of the major, unforeseen 
    successes of the project. The infants, on the other hand, may have needed 
    a lot more mentoring, but they totally enjoyed looking at their work and hearing 
    their voices on the computers. Parents were able to use some of these programmes 
    on their home computers, and therefore enhance learning by complementing the 
    schools' programmes. The teachers were presented with well-constructed exemplars, 
    which allowed for as much creativity as they wished to input, in the development 
    of both the Gaelic and English language programmes. </p>
  <p>An unexpected impact of the project, was the demand from a variety of schools 
    for access to the phonetic and wordlists, the drama programmes, and the multimedia 
    presentations. The possibilities for using the project in the teaching of 
    minority languages and other major European languages in a bilingual setting, 
    was also recognised, as it was felt that the project addressed language teaching 
    methodology in a novel manner. Some students attending teacher training college 
    at third level requested permission to try out some of the Gaelic programmes 
    and they found these extremely effective in classrooms, encouraging schools 
    around Ireland to request permission to download the information. </p>
  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong> <br>
    As stated at the outset, language and its usage is one of the most important 
    means of communication in the world. Our project continues to show us that 
    this is a very complex and challenging area of the Revised Curriculum especially 
    in a bilingual environment. In essence, the major contribution of our project 
    to understanding children with learning difficulties, the process of education 
    and new technologies is that they should not be mutually exclusive. Not alone 
    that, but young dyslexic children such as Tom, are like natural sponges, absorbing 
    at deeper levels through body and mind, and well able to handle the challenges 
    of the technological world and an extra language, through the medium of a 
    more traditional curricular area -- drama. Teachers also, when presented with 
    a curricular framework for the development of language skills, were able to 
    integrate their own knowledge with ICT, to creatively produce exemplars for 
    the development of confidence in language usage, which could be emulated by 
    any school. These facts lead the author to believe that the project will continue 
    to develop after SIP and more importantly, be emulated and replicated in other 
    local, national, and international settings to open up new avenues of thought 
    and possibilities for in-service education. </p>
  <p>Tom, as a literary six-year old 125 IQ dyslexic, with all of his academic 
    problems has shown that IT, when creatively integrated with, and connected 
    to his preferential learning style, can open those other 'windows of wonder' 
    to boost self-confidence and enhance the learning experiences both inside 
    and outside the classroom. The most significant remaining challenge for us 
    teachers, is to continue our work and be satisfied that we shall probably 
    never reach a stage when we can say that we have actually realised all the 
    ramifications of our own learning curve when dealing with children like Tom, 
    in a bilingual environment. They say that from small acorns grow great oak 
    trees. We look upon our project from the point of view of the well-planted 
    acorn and hope that the participation of other schools and organisations will 
    continue to nurture it. </p>
  <p>There is no doubt in our minds that this project has incredible possibilities 
    and far-reaching implications for teachers, learning support in schools, in-service 
    education in a bilingual environment and the development of language skills 
    internationally. It is hoped that schools will download the information and 
    associated links to the 'Avenues of Thought and Areas of Practical Experience 
    for In-Service Education', at <a href="http://www.gaelscoil.com/site2002">www.gaelscoil.com/site2002</a> 
    and eventually design their own programmes and multimedia presentations. All 
    that remains is a recent comment from Tom as he sat confidently at his computer; 
    &quot;You know M&aacute;istir, even my Dad thinks this is great fun, isn't 
    it?&quot;</p>
