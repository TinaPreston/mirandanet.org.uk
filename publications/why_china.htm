    <h3> Abstract</h3>
    <p> This paper asks why we should link our schools with educators in China, 
      gives the background to a London comprehensive school&#8217;s approach to 
      previous international collaborations, and describes early attempts to forge 
      new links with Chinese schools and colleges. It then presents case studies 
      of successful collaborations with schools and universities in several countries, 
      most notably with Japan, and ends with a hyperlink to further information 
      about how to undertake, develop and evaluate such projects. </p>
    <p> Follow the links for detailed outlines of international drama, science 
      and music projects.</p>

      (Roughly to scale&#8230;.) !</p>
    <h3> Why link with China? </h3>
    <p> The following points are taken from a <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/newsroom_and_speeches/press/2005/press_20_05.cfm">speech</a> 
      by the Rt. Hon. Gordon Brown MP, Chancellor of the Exchequer, given at the 
      Academy of Social Science, Beijing, China on 21st February, 2005:</p>
    <p> &#8226; &#8220;Our aim is to encourage UK education and training providers 
      to work internationally in partnership with business<br>
      &#8226; We want to make the UK an international leader in the creative and 
      supportive use of IT for education<br>
      &#8226; We want to promote the role of our universities as international 
      hubs for learning and research<br>
      &#8226; And we want to promote further expansion in the number of international 
      students at UK further and higher education institutions &#8211; both in 
      Britain and in off-shore campuses abroad like those already being pioneered, 
      here in China, by Nottingham University and Napier University.&#8221;</p>
    <h3> Background</h3>
    <p> <a href="http://www.holycross.kingston.sch.uk/">The Holy Cross Schoo</a>l, 
      a specialist Science College in Kingston, Surrey, is currently working with 
      the <a href="http://www.specialistschools.org.uk/">Specialist Schools and 
      Academies&#8217; Trust</a> to meet each of these aims, and what follows 
      here is information about a series of projects that other schools might 
      wish to consider, when developing their own <a href="../international/ukchina.htm">links 
      with China</a>.</p>
    <p> Holy Cross has been working with middle schools, high schools, and universities 
      in Japan, the USA, and elsewhere for over ten years, and some of the projects 
      developed using email, video-conferencing, and the internet, are applicable 
      in principle to educational collaborations with China. </p>
    <p> <strong>The focus of our work is in bringing students in different countries 
      together in peaceful understanding, through music, dance, and drama, as 
      well as through cultural and scientific collaborations (<a href="../ftp/lwilliams4.pdf">open 
      a PDF document with further ideas</a>).</strong></p>
    <h3> Current work with China</h3>
    <p> The Holy Cross School is currently developing a series of projects with 
      schools and colleges in Beijing. A report on how these links were formed 
      can be found on the MirandaNet web site under the <a href="../international/ukchina.htm">International 
      MirandaNet section UK-China links</a>.</p>
    <p> We are now creating hyperlinks between the various web pages and web sites 
      that carry our projects, so that teachers can more easily find suitable 
      project materials and case studies for their consideration. The Specialist 
      Schools and Academies Trust is kindly providing web space for this work, 
      so that ideas can be shared across the specialist schools in the UK. <a href="http://www.schoolsnetwork.org.uk/uploads/documents/ICT_Update_A06_124051.pdf">See 
      page three of the August ICT for a report on our work with China, so far: 
      Chinese Connections</a> (pdf file). What follows is a series of descriptive 
      headings, with hyperlinks to relevant web materials.</p>
    <p> <strong>Email correspondence. </strong></p>
    <p>This section is currently under development, and will show in detail how 
      initial email correspondence with teachers and teacher trainers in China 
      became translated into working, and hopefully successful collaborations, 
      at different levels.</p>
    <p> The following ICT projects were developed with partners in Japan and the 
      USA, but can be easily adapted for similar project work with Chinese schools</p>
    <h3> Two Drama Case Studies:</h3>
    <p> 1. <a href="https://wec.mirandanet.org.uk/gallery/holycross/drama.htm">A 
      Classroom Drama Project about Shakespeare</a>, linking London students with 
      students in Osaka. Illustrated. </p>
    <p><img src="williams/video_shakespeare.jpg" alt="Drama video link" title="Drama video link" width="480" height="360"></p>
    <p> Key words: Email, drama and video-conferencing, international.</p>
    <p> 2. An International Drama Project, with a play performance of &#8220;The 
      Kabuki Gift&#8221;, by Douglas Love. This was performed in two countries 
      simultaneously, with the music and costumes developed in both countries. 
      Text only. (Before the age of digital cameras!) (<a href="../ftp/lwilliams2.pdf">Follow 
      this linke to open a PDF file about this project. </a>Note: You will need 
      to scroll down through a series of other projects to reach &#8220;Kabuki 
      Gift&#8221;.)</p>
    <p> Key words: Drama, cross-curricular work, international</p>
    <h3> International Science Projects:</h3>
    <p> 1. <a href="http://www.clifton-scientific.org/j2001/">Japan 2001 &#8220;Science, 
      Creativity and the Young Mind&#8221;</a>, developed with the Clifton Scientific 
      Trust, and with a web site in English and Japanese. Students worked in international 
      groups to explore &#8220;Real World&#8221; scientific problems. This week-long 
      event was hosted by Bristol University, and later presented at the ASE Conference. 
      This project included an exploration of the formation of volcanoes on Mars, 
      and was the fore-runner of the Science Through Arts Project detailed below. 
      Illustrated.</p>
    <p><img src="williams/japan2001.jpg" alt="Japan 2001" title="Japan 2001" width="300" height="225"></p>
    <p>Key words: Science, multinational, collaboration, creativity. </p>
    <p> 2. <a href="http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/STAR/Cosmos/index.htm">Science 
      Through Arts, or STAR</a>: This is an international science collaboration 
      devised by The Holy Cross School and developed with NASA scientists in Cleveland, 
      Ohio, USA. The aim is to study appropriately selected NASA space science 
      data on the web, and to transform it into narrative work, film scripts, 
      poetry, music, and art. Learning outcomes by students are then posted on 
      the NASA web site. See further STAR web sites below. Illustrated. </p>
    <p><a href="http://www.integratedsite.co.uk/">The Holy Cross Integrated Web 
      Site for STAR</a>. This is a Teachers&#8217; Support Site for those working 
      on the STAR Project. It does what it says on the tin. There are links to 
      other useful web sites from here, to encourage teachers to work in this 
      cross-curricular way. It includes sections on the pedagogy, some video-conferencing 
      partnerships, English lesson plans, and the history of the project.</p>
    <p> The Learning Outcomes of Holy Cross students working on the STAR project 
      are displayed on the NASA web site, in the USA. They show the high quality 
      of work completed by students in a south London comprehensive school:</p>

    <p>3. <a href="../international/ukjapan.htm">UK- Japan Young Scientists Workshop</a>, 
      held at Surrey University, August 2006. Working with academics from Surrey 
      University, students from UK and Japanese secondary schools worked to solve 
      &#8220;Real World&#8221; science questions, such as global warming, nanotechnology, 
      and water for the world. Illustrated. </p>

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p> <a href="https://wec.mirandanet.org.uk/gallery/holycross/music.htm">An 
      International Music Festival</a> &#8211; This is an annual event, raising 
      money for UNICEF simultaneously in London and Osaka. Students sing, dance, 
      act and share Christmas festivities by video-conference. It&#8217;s the 
      highlight of the Holy Cross School year. We definitely plan to carry this 
      idea forward in our links with China, now using IP instead of ISDN links.
