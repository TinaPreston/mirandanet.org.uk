  <h2>Managing ICT: Review</h2>
  <p><em>Managing ICT </em>by Terry Freedman (Hodder and Stoughton) ISBN 0-340-75334-X</p>
  <p>This is one of the Effective Teaching Skills series edited by Professor Trevor 
    Kerry. I came to this book as someone interested in computers but no way am 
    I an ICT coordinator. Now I've read it I reckon I could do well at interview 
    - if I were mad enough to want to move from one coordinating role to another. 
    A recent conversation with Alastair Wells convinced me that being an ICT coordinator 
    is rather too like being a SENCO.</p>
  <p>This in fact is a book that should appeal to at least three audiences that 
    I can think of. Firstly there is the aspiring ICT coordinator. This is a book 
    that tells you what you need to know if you wish to go down that road. Secondly, 
    if you are already a coordinator then it provides a useful bench mark against 
    which to judge yourself. Finally, this is a book that would prove most useful 
    for a head teacher who needs to know what they might expect from their ICT 
    coordinator.</p>
  <p>The book takes you clearly and logically through all the issues you need 
    to consider starting with the personal skills required to do the job. This 
    I think is a vital area that is not always considered. (How many schools are 
    stuck with an anally retentive ex-maths teacher who doesn't really like people 
    using his toys.) As Terry says, "If you are a "techie" who would rather be 
    in a room with a file server than helping someone save their work, then managing 
    ICT in a school or college is not for you."</p>
  <p>Terry does not attempt to provide a definitive list of answers to all the 
    questions you might want to ask but what he does do is is make sure you know 
    what questions you might need to ask. For example if you are about to go down 
    the network route then you need to know exactly the right questions to ask 
    potential installation companies. Lack of sufficient detail when you write 
    the contract can result in a lot of unexpected additional expense with over 
    runs and so on. Terry admits he is not in the business of providing a technical 
    manual but I found myself repeatedly muttering "oh, right, hmm" and so on 
    as I worked through his chapter on infra structure. I particularly liked the 
    comment that if you are too effective in your use of old computers then the 
    management may not so easily understand the necessity to replace equipment 
    on a planned five year cycle. It was also refreshing to see that Terry shares 
    my view that platforms are less important than actual access.</p>
  <p>The chapter on INSET was interesting too, though it doesn't mention NOF money 
    - probably the book went to press before the details were known but the advice 
    on auditing staff skills is still valid, particularly what you do with the 
    results.</p>
  <p>As a MirandaNet person my main interest lies in how teachers use the Internet 
    so I saved this chapter till last (conveniently this is its position in the 
    book). This chapter has some little gems in it that are obvious once you consider 
    them. For example if you have an intranet then any old piece of junk can run 
    a web browser and load those beautifully lean HTML pages. so my old A5000s 
    still have a useful life ahead of them.</p>
  <p>The discussion on undesirable web content caused me to think as well. Terry 
    points out that there are circumstances when you may actually want children 
    to look at racist sites. This means that you may have problems with a filtered 
    managed service or software that blocks keywords. This chapter illustrates 
    one of the problems with traditional printed media, especially books. The 
    time between writing a book and publication is so great that in the fast moving 
    field of technology important innovations occur after the book has gone to 
    press and the reader is tempted to wonder why the omissions are there. Well, 
    Terry mentions the National Grid for Learning so full marks there, but not 
    in the chapter on the Internet but rather the one on managing the paperwork 
    and then only briefly at the end of the chapter. The second edition (which 
    I sincerely hope will appear quickly) is sure to remedy this but who knows 
    what new developments will then be missed! None the less, there are a number 
    of mentions throughout the book of items that were precursors to the NGFL 
    and in that sense the book provides useful background.</p>
  <p>To conclude, this is an excellent text for anyone wanting to know how to 
    go about being an ICT coordinator. It is clearly laid out, written in a jargon 
    free manner and has a good appendix full of useful web sites and printed document 
    resources. See: <a href="http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~etfreedman/index.htm">easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~etfreedman/index.htm</a></p>
