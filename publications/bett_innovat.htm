  <blockquote>&quot;Education is simply the soul of society as it passes from 
    one generation to another&quot;.<br>
    <span class="author">G. K. Chesterton &nbsp;1924</span></blockquote>
  <p>The challenges the teaching profession faces globally is far greater than 
    professional differences between nations. However the picture looks optimistic. 
    Advanced technologies allow teachers to reach out across social, cultural, 
    economic and vocational divides in the global village, breaking down ignorance 
    and creating hope and new opportunities. Social inclusion has never looked 
    so attainable.</p>
  <p>In the global village, teachers who have knowledge, age and experience on 
    their side must also be flexible and open minded learners themselves prepared 
    to learn from their peers and their students.</p>
  <p>In our research study, <em>Teachers as Innovators</em>, Professor Cox, Kate 
    Cox and myself have focused on teachers who are already confident in the use 
    of ICT in the expectation that their works and their opinions will encourage 
    their colleagues to move forward We have defined confident and innovative 
    ICT users as teachers in the who are using computers in the classroom and 
    for administrative tasks. These teachers will meet the standards set by the 
    Teacher Training Agency ICT syllabus which are quite tough. They have their 
    own computer with Internet access and their own email address.</p>
  <p>Contrary to expectations the teachers who met these criteria were not all 
    young. The average age was 45: most were senior managers. Their first degrees 
    were across the subject range and only one per cent had a formal degree in 
    IT. Some had had no ICT training at all. Yet although they felt inadequately 
    trained they were teaching their peers with some success.</p>
  <p>These teachers who were comfortable with computers were agreed that computers 
    increased pupils motivation and helped them to learn. Most of them thought 
    that improved capacity and expanded resources for independent learning, offered 
    opportunities to vary the pace of learning, improved presentation and increased 
    concentration.</p>
  <p>In this keynote innovative teacher professionals raise the issues that are 
    important to them.</p>
  <p>To start with Peter O'Hagan, Special Projects Co-ordinator from Stoke on 
    Trent, believes that for too long there has been an emphasis on the power 
    of technology. A concentration on the speed and power of ICT.</p>
  <p>&quot;A few providers and practitioners are concentrating also on the Why 
    and How. How can the technology available to education contribute to life 
    long learning? Why should we use the available technology? What difference 
    can/will it make?</p>
  <p>Today young people are on games consoles and in games arcades battling with 
    problems beyond our comprehension, slaying mythical beasts and wrestling with 
    the enemies of Laura Croft. They readily share solutions and fixes with friends 
    and family. Then we bring them into school, sit them down in monastic rows 
    and give them Caxton technology of the middle ages to work with. No wonder 
    they are disillusioned.</p>
  <p>To go forward the teaching profession needs to embrace the 5 Cs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Connectivity - Not OFTEL connectivity, ISDN, ASDL etc. But places where 
      people of all ages can connect with learning opportunities appropriate to 
      their individual needs.</li>
    <li>Content - That harnesses the power of the technology that is imaginative 
      in its creation and delivery, (NOT books on screens).</li>
    <li>Culture - We need to develop a culture that accepts and embraces new ways 
      of learning.</li>
    <li>Co-operation and Partnerships - We need to ensure that all those involved 
      in the development of the learning process. Educationalists, manufacturers 
      (hardware and software), and learners themselves all work together.</li>
    <li>Communities - The development of learning communities, local, regional, 
      national and multinational will facilitate a greater mutual understanding 
      and ensure mutual development.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We can encourage Just in Time Learning and improve social inclusion. We must 
    reconstruct our understanding of the processes involved in teaching and learning&quot;.</p>
  <p>Sue Heightman, Deputy Head at Tolworth Girls School, discusses the important 
    of ICT in professional development with a group of trainee teachers. The National 
    Grid for Leaning and the Virtual Teachers Centre offer a wealth of resources 
    for teachers. Teachers have little time in their professional life to observe 
    good practice in other schools as they did as trainees. But the Internet offers 
    a window on the work of peers not just in the UK and internationally. Most 
    important the Internet offers a means of creating self-help communities of 
    teachers.</p>
  <p>Basia Korczak, an ICT teacher in Ilford, tells us how the students and teachers 
    at Valentines School get involved in the use of ICT. Basia has developed a 
    variety of strategies for using the Internet to create resources, promote 
    collaborative learning and develop on-line communities. She is aiming for 
    the whole school to have Oracle email addresses. As Early Adopters of Scoop, 
    the Oracle based learning environment, over half the sixth form have already 
    created their first web publications, used the brainstorming facility and 
    entered a question and answer session Valentine School's feedback will be 
    invaluable to the Oracle Scoop team as they develop this learning environment 
    for the use of learning communities.</p>
  <p>John Cuthell of Boston Spa School in Yorkshire highlights teachers need for 
    time and space to reflect, to understand their role, work beyond their initial 
    responses and debate the ways in which teachers can shape the effects of change. 
    One of the great strengths of an active on-line professional community such 
    as MirandaNet, he says, is to have a forum within which questions can be asked, 
    responses posted and suggestions made. &quot;Members of MirandaNet come from 
    diverse backgrounds: what we all have in common is that we're all living on 
    the edge of chaos. We'd like to think that we¹re learning, that we're thriving 
    in chaos, managing the change: understanding the potential of Information 
    and Communication Technologies: passing on some of the benefits to the students 
    with whom we teach, work and learn.&quot;</p>
  <p>MirandaNet Fellows value the opportunity to make sustained contact with colleagues 
    internationally on the Internet. Many international Fellows are struggling 
    with political, social and economic factors that put British professional 
    issues in context.</p>
  <p>Bozena Mannova , Czech Technical University, Prague, and Sarah Quilty, School 
    of Education, University of Ulster, talk about the impact of ICT exchange 
    projects on the teachers and the students.</p>
  <p>&quot;On the first day of our joint project,&quot; Bozena said, &quot;there 
    was not so much interest in communication, but by the second and third days, 
    teachers and students were just sitting by the computers and they were really 
    very happy. For them, it was new to make friends by computer. From that time 
    on, they were on the Netd@ys pages often and electronic communication for 
    them took on an entirely new dimension.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sarah agreed, &quot;I think the Irish experience was similar - ours was the 
    last day, Friday. When the students discovered they could E-chat electronically 
    with new friends in other parts of Europe they really came alive. It was a 
    matter of teachers begging them to leave the computer rooms for their other 
    classes - that was a new pedagogical experience for some staff. The students 
    and teachers gained new experience and new confidence from working on their 
    own web sites and in future they will not be so hesitant about trying out 
    new experiences in ICTs. In fact, when we had our debriefing session via video-conference 
    (the schools are about 70 miles apart) the teachers discussed how they would 
    collaborate more frequently and plan opportunities for the pupils to do likewise.&quot;</p>
  <p>Building communities on-line is greatly influenced by the software that is 
    available. Ben Franklin, Plume school, Maldon Essex, describes some of the 
    learning environments MirandaNet Fellows have used.</p>
  <p>&quot;The MirandaNet Fellowship publish our articles and case studies as 
    well as useful resources for other teachers on our website, (<a href="../index.html">www.mirandanet.org.uk</a>). 
    However, for our community to be effective we must be able to communicate 
    effectively with each other, to debate and to reflect. Our Internet communication 
    has been a major element in MirandaNet's development as a functioning virtual 
    community.</p>
  <p>We have found that the features of the Internet software we use are a major 
    factor in the effectiveness of our communication. When MirandaNet Fellows 
    first began to experiment with on-line conferencing we used a Unix based system. 
    This was a bit of a nightmare! Luckily as our knowledge and sophistication 
    have increased, so has Internet technology improved.</p>
  <p>We use Mirandalink as a communications tool. It is not perfect - it is not 
    graphical for instance but you can download messages and read them off-line. 
    Because you cannot see threads it can be confusing at times and we have found 
    that reply buttons are a problem for some people! It is a little like being 
    dependent on a hearing aid - you pick up all the sound and have to then filter 
    it yourself. The important thing about Mirandalink however is that it allows 
    passive involvement. For many people it is enough to listen in on the sometimes 
    arcane conversations.</p>
  <p>We are particularly lucky to be involved now in a software pilot with Oracle. 
    This involvement is giving us a chance to design the software environment 
    we really need for communication. OMP, or Scoop as it is more widely known, 
    is deceptively powerful. Although it is still in a developmental phase it 
    does a number of very sophisticated things very easily which make it a powerful 
    community tool. For instance, it allows the creation of web pages which are 
    interactive as well as allowing easy on-line messaging and e-mail. For anyone 
    not familiar with WWW protocols it makes these processes very simple. It also 
    allows community members to share ideas and information in a straightforward 
    way.</p>
  <p>You can register for an Early Adopters pilot of this software on the MirandaNet 
    website if you are interested.</p>
  <p>We are also piloting our own expert advice service for teachers sponsored 
    by Compaq and Oracle where we plan to mentor other teachers who want to know 
    more about ICT.</p>
  <p>Michelle Selinger the director of CeNTRE at Warwick University has some advice 
    for teachers who want to set up their own on-line communities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>View the appropriate software</li>
    <li>Design your learning environment carefully</li>
    <li>Decide whether forums should be open or closed</li>
    <li>If closed, consider whether latecomers can be allowed in</li>
    <li>Decide on the content balance between resources, publication and discussion</li>
    <li>Consider the optimum size of the community</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Michelle stresses the human factor in creating a sustainable community. Strategies 
    she recommends to leaders are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Establish good initial relationships: face to face if possible</li>
    <li>Ensure familiarity with the on-line communication system</li>
    <li>Get to know the participants well</li>
    <li>Sell on-line discussions to them</li>
    <li>Ensure all participants know the purpose of each forum</li>
    <li>Make sure there is something to read and there is a real reason to use 
      it</li>
    <li>Encourage introductory messages especially if there has been no prior 
      face-to-face meeting</li>
    <li>Establish clear guidelines and parameters within which to work</li>
    <li>Encourage reluctant members to contribute by</li>
    <ul>
      <li>sending email messages</li>
      <li>inviting joint contributions</li>
      <li>commenting on contributions before they are posted</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>Michelle's suggestions will help teachers who are training their peers in 
    ICT. There is not enough helpful advice about teachers training needs and 
    suggestions for course content.</p>
  <p>Conversely, teachers are not asked frequently enough what kind of training 
    they really want. In our study, Teachers as Innovators, confident and innovative 
    teachers explained what kind of training they had found most effective. They 
    recommended a variety of approaches: initial awareness courses to start ideas 
    flowing, short courses with manageable time-spans and sustainable long term 
    curriculum integration, courses with on-line links. They thought that courses 
    worked better if the levels and ability of the teacher/learners were matched 
    and the content had direct relevance to the classroom and staff room. School-based 
    practical training was popular using familiar equipment.</p>
  <p>These innovative teachers were also articulate about their own training needs. 
    There are not enough professional development opportunities for the leaders 
    and the Early Adopters at the right level. These wanted long term ICT support, 
    mentoring and teaching that challenged them to change their own practice and 
    develop changes in learning in their institution. They had found that mentoring 
    other colleagues helped them to learn and they were willing to put time aside 
    to be involved in an active professional development community, on-line and 
    face to face.</p>
  <p>The evidence from this study indicates that if we as a society want to more 
    teachers to be confident and innovative users of ICT we must give teachers 
    the time and the facilities they need. We have made a good start in the UK. 
    We must continue to build on the funding for the National Grid for Learning 
    and the grants for on-line computers for teachers. What teachers need now 
    are effective peer training communities on-line and face to face so that the 
    profession can learn together. Pooling their talents and expertise and agreeing 
    to roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty. Learning can be painful. 
    The profession has to triumph over the pain barrier if teachers are to make 
    a real contribution to this centuries achievements in universal education.</p>
