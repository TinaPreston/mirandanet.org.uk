  <h2>The ICT in Education Website and Subscription Service</h2>

  <p>[<a href="http://www.ictineducation.org">www.ictineducation.org</a>]</p>
  <p> The ICT in Education was set up nearly ten years ago. The aim of the website 
    was very clear from the outset: to provide teachers and others with practical 
    guidance on using information and communication technology in the classroom, 
    whether for administration or for curriculum purposes. The facts that the 
    UK's department for education and science (DfES) decided (unsolicited) to 
    provide a link to the site from their own website, and that it was one of 
    the first sites in the country to be awarded National Grid for Learning approval, 
    certainly did no harm to the site's credibility.</p>
  <p> As well as there being a host of articles on the website, together with 
    podcasts, which are freely downloadable, and a range of digital products for 
    sale, two subscription services are also available.</p>
  <p> One of these, which you may be familiar with, is the electronic newsletter 
    called Computers in Classrooms. This was launched around 1999, and then was 
    suspended when I went to work for the QCA. (The QCA and other governmental 
    organisations do not approve of individuals publishing work under their own 
    name for a very good reason: people often assume that they are espousing official 
    policy through the back door!) It has since been revived, and its subscriber 
    list growing steadily. More of that in a moment.</p>
  <p> A few months ago we also launched a paid-for subscription service known 
    as the Premium Subscription service, which is also covered below.</p>
  <p> But first, why provide ANY subscription service, free or otherwise? After 
    all, it would be easy enough to publish everything on the website, and sit 
    and wait for the visitors to arrive. There are two reasons why that approach 
    isn't enough on its own. Firstly, anyone working in education does not have 
    the time to trawl through umpteen websites every day, or even every week, 
    to see what's new. The ICT in Education website is often updated every day, 
    including weekends, so not checking it for a week could mean &#8220;missing&#8221; 
    half a dozen or more articles. Secondly, some people prefer newsletters to 
    website articles: not much effort is involved in receiving them, plus you 
    can print off the whole thing and read several articles over breakfast.</p>
  <p> There is even a third option available, a sort of compromise between going 
    to the website and signing up for the newsletter. Many people reading this 
    will have heard of blogs, or online journals. Some may have also come across 
    the idea of the RSS feed. This sounds complicated, but RSS &#8211; standing 
    for Really Simple Syndication &#8211; makes it possible for you to be told 
    whenever the blog has a new entry. You can subscribe to several blogs in this 
    way, and &#8211; here's the beauty of the whole approach &#8211; only look 
    at one website, or in one place on your desktop, for any updates.</p>
  <p> Now, in common with many other sites, especially newspapers and other information 
    portals, the ICT in Education provides an RSS feed so that you can be alerted 
    to new content, which you can then choose to look at or take a rain check 
    on for the time being.</p>
  <p> So, what do the subscriptions provide that the website doesn't? Let's start 
    with the Premium Subscription service. What the Premium Subscription service 
    does is take the view that less is more: articles tend to be less discursive 
    than the ones typically posted on the free part of the website or in the newsletter, 
    whilst the regular e-briefing provides top-level information in no more than 
    two sides of A4 &#8211; frequently less. The articles are often on &#8220;uncommercial&#8221; 
    topics as well, the kind of thing you won't usually see in a standard newsletter 
    or magazine because they are too specialised.</p>
  <p> For example, there was a series on how to get a job as an ICT manager, another 
    on displaying children's work properly, and a briefing paper on how to go 
    about changing or implementing a management information system in a school. 
    The e-briefing, which is usually published every week or two, contains information 
    about new government directives and research reports &#8211; not just from 
    the UK but from all over the world. In fact, we've estimated that on this 
    basis alone, the subscription rate of &pound;60 (+ VAT) pays for itself on 
    receipt of the very first e-briefing, due to the time savings involved.</p>
  <p> Of course, many people are quite content with the free subscription service. 
    After all, it is open to all, and contains a wealth of practical advice and 
    guidance on implementing ICT. The fascinating thing for me is that subscribers 
    come from all over the world &#8211; and they all face the same issues!</p>
  <p> The composition of the subscription lists, and of visitors to the website, 
    is very interesting in itself. The website receives an average of 300 unique 
    visits a day, mainly from people living in the UK or the USA, but also from 
    other countries such as Singapore, Saudi Arabia and European countries. The 
    free newsletter is subscribed to by education advisors from local education 
    authorities in the UK, employees of governmental agencies and private corporations 
    in the UK, and teachers (especially ICT co-ordinators) from all over the world. 
    The Premium Subscription service has attracted senior subject leaders for 
    ICT as well as school district supervisors or similar.</p>
  <p> So what of the future? The short answer is: who knows? But we have already 
    experimented with blogs, wikis and, now, podcasts. Perhaps in future we will 
    provide digital video-based articles, and we've started to experiment with 
    constructing QuickTime movies. One thing is for certain: whenever we try out 
    new technologies we'll be interested to see how useful they might be in the 
    classroom!</p>
