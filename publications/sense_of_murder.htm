  <h4><a name="int"></a>Introduction</h4>
  <p class="centeredImage"><img src="bunce/image002.gif" alt="Murder, Mystery, and...Datablogging" title="Murder, Mystery, and...Datablogging" width="647" height="336"></p>
  <p>Interpreting sensor data can be a difficult area for the pupils to understand. 
    How can we make datalogging interesting? Our idea was to solve a murder at 
    the Data Inn. The pupils looked at the data for each of the rooms: light, 
    sound and temperature; they then tried to deduct whether the suspects' alibis 
    matched with the data.</p>
  <p>The learning activities were reinforced with practical sessions using the 
    dataloggers, in order for the pupils to make a connection between the real-life 
    data collection and what it means.</p>
  <p>The outcomes were the pupils really enjoyed the problem-solving, developed 
    a firm-foundation in interpreting data and the quality of the conversations 
    and use of language surprised everyone. Whodunnit? - You&#8217;ll have to 
    find out!</p>
  <h4><a name="itc"></a>In the classroom </h4>
  <p>Each lesson was based around the three-part model of starter, main and plenary 
    sessions, with clear objectives outlining the learning points. A major feature 
    was the pupils&#8217; discussions and explanations of their ideas and so there 
    were many assessment for learning opportunities. As each lesson was linked 
    to practical activities and demonstrations of datalogging, the pupils fully 
    engaged in carrying out the experiments and were able to explain what was 
    happening.</p>
  <h4><a name="til"></a>The introductory lesson</h4>
  <p>We started the topic looking at the opening scenes of the software, &#8216;<strong>A 
    Sense of Murder</strong>&#8217; (available from Commotion, <a href="http://www.commotiongroup.co.uk">www.commotiongroup.co.uk</a> 
    01732 773399). This introduced the background brief to the murder of Lux Lumens, 
    the Industrial Tycoon. Also, the pupils met the four suspects, Hugh Middity, 
    Val Ume, Anna Logg and Darren Heit. This opened a dialogue between the pupils 
    about &#8216;How and where do you think the murder took place? Can people 
    look guilty just by their appearance? Who do you think had the greatest motive?&#8217;</p>
  <p>The first lesson held the key to creating the excitement and interest in 
    the topic. The class looked at the newspaper article explaining the murder 
    case; they had been chosen as the detectives to solve the murder.</p>
  <div class="centered"> 
    <table class="centered-table" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
      <tr> 
        <td><img src="bunce/image003.jpg" alt="There&#8217;s been a murder" title="There&#8217;s been a murder"width="302" height="228"></td>
        <td><img src="bunce/image004.jpg" alt="Considering the suspects&#8217; alibis" title="Considering the suspects&#8217; alibis"width="301" height="227"></td>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
        <td>There&#8217;s been a murder</td>
        <td>Considering the suspects&#8217; alibis</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>Now that the children were hooked, an &#8216;Odd-one-out&#8217; activity 
    was used to warm their brains up. The activity started simply with three suspects 
    from the murder.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="block">Teacher: &#8220;Who is the odd-one-out?&#8221; (Choices: 
      Anna, Darren and Hugh)<br>
      Pupils: &#8220;Anna, because she&#8217;s the only girl.&#8221; &#8220;Hugh, 
      because he&#8217;s wearing glasses.&#8221; &#8220;Darren, because he looks 
      worried.&#8221; &#8220;Anna, because she looks angry.&#8221;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The next odd-one-out pages developed the pupils&#8217; ideas and the teacher 
    ensured that as the activity developed, that all of the class were involved. 
    The choices changed from people to objects.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="block">Teacher: &#8220;Which is the odd-one-out?&#8221; (Choices: 
      Television, radio and mobile phone)<br>
      Pupil 1: &#8220;Radio, because it doesn&#8217;t have a screen.&#8221; <br>
      Pupil 2: &#8220;Mobile phone, because you can talk to it.&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 3: &#8220;Radio, because it&#8217;s not interactive.&#8221;<br>
      Teacher: &#8220;What do you mean by interactive?&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 4: &#8220;You can press the red button on the TV and get more information 
      and you can press buttons on the phone and get more information, the radio 
      just makes sounds.&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 5: &#8220;You can change stations to get more information.&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 6: &#8220;But that&#8217;s just lucky if you get what you want, on 
      the TV you can get to play games and on the phone.&#8221;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <div class="centered"> 
    <table class="centered-table" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
      <tr> 
        <td><img src="bunce/image005.jpg" alt="Who is the odd-one-out?" title="Who is the odd-one-out?"width="301" height="226"></td>
        <td><img src="bunce/image006.jpg" alt="Which is the odd-one-out?" title="Which is the odd-one-out?"width="301" height="226"></td>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
        <td>Who is the odd-one-out?</td>
        <td>Which is the odd-one-out?</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>The final choices were &#8216;Light&#8217;, &#8216;Sound&#8217; and &#8216;Temperature&#8217;. 
    This proved to be much harder for the class as the choices were not objects 
    i.e. if the options were a light bulb, radio and fan heater, they would be 
    able to find the odd-one-out more easily. After discussion with each other 
    in pairs, the pupils returned their ideas.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="block">Pupil 1: &#8220;We think sound is the odd-one-out, because 
      a light bulb gives out light and gets hot.&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 2: &#8220;You can get sound from lights, these strip lights in the 
      classroom make a buzzing noise, so sound isn&#8217;t the odd-one-out.&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 3: &#8220;The Sun gives out light and heat, but doesn&#8217;t make 
      any sound.&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 4: &#8220;It might do, but we&#8217;re too far away to hear it.&#8221;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The lesson moved on to a new activity of describing pictures and graphs. 
    The aim was for the pupils to realise the importance of using precise language 
    to explain and communicate their ideas.</p>
  <div class="centered"> 
    <table class="centered-table" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
      <tr> 
        <td><img src="bunce/image007.jpg" alt="Describing the pictures" title="Describing the pictures"width="301" height="227"></td>
        <td><img src="bunce/image008.jpg" alt="Pupils&#8217; drawings" title="Pupils&#8217; drawings"width="171" height="228"></td>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
        <td>Describing the pictures</td>
        <td>Pupils&#8217; drawings</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>The pupils worked in pairs, sitting back-to-back. One pupil described the 
    six pictures and the other attempted to draw them. They were allowed five 
    minutes, but they were not allowed to look at each other&#8217;s pictures 
    until the time was up. Then they compared the pictures and discussed the words 
    they had used to instruct and question during the drawing. The pupils then 
    wrote these words on the interactive whiteboard. A rich variety of words were 
    collected, &#8216;straight, percentage, diagonal&#8217; and they also used 
    angles, points on the compass and the hours on the clock to describe the directions 
    to draw the lines.</p>
  <div class="centered"> 
    <table class="centered-table" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
      <tr> 
        <td><img src="bunce/image009.jpg" alt="Key vocabulary used by the pupils" title="Key vocabulary used by the pupils"width="305" height="233"></td>
        <td><img src="bunce/image010.jpg" alt="Who has an idea?" title="Who has an idea?"width="302" height="227"></td>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
        <td>Key vocabulary used by the pupils</td>
        <td>Who has an idea?</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>The class all thought that they had drawn the pictures accurately. After 
    praising them, it was pointed out to them that even though they had captured 
    the shapes well, they needed to evaluate the positioning on the page and the 
    scale of the drawings. After the pupils gave themselves brief self-evaluations, 
    they swapped over and it was the instructor&#8217;s turn to draw and vice 
    versa. This time the pupils were much more precise in their language to guide 
    each other and in the positioning and scale of the drawings.</p>
  <p>The final part of the lesson attempted to link the pupils&#8217; precise 
    language to describe graphs of data; this was to aid their work in interpreting 
    the datalogging information.</p>
  <p>Each pupil was given a different sheet which had a graph on the top half 
    and a blank set of axes on the lower half. The pupils had to find a person 
    with the corresponding graph, so that they could draw the trace on their lower 
    graph. For example, the top graph could contain light data and the lower blank 
    graph could be labelled in decibels. Therefore, this pupil would need to find 
    another one who had the sound graph data. This pupil could then find another 
    pupil who needed to draw the light data on their graph. The class really enjoyed 
    the activity, finding the appropriate match and then going through the challenge 
    of describing the journey of the data.</p>
  <p>The lesson concluded by reviewing the main teaching points and highlighting 
    the richness of the language the class had used. The software was revisited 
    to read the murder newspaper article and to think of questions they would 
    like to ask the suspects.</p>
  <h3><a name="tll"></a>The Light lesson</h3>
  <p>The next lesson focussed on the light sensor and where light sensors might 
    be used, for example, night lights in a baby&#8217;s room or security lights, 
    which switch on overnight. The starter activity began by looking at real data. 
    The datalogger was connected to the projector and the pupils watched the data 
    trace appear. The graph line jumped around the screen as the datalogger was 
    pointed at the classroom lights, at the daylight coming through the window, 
    at the shade under a desk and when covered with a hand. Then all the lights 
    were switched off and the blinds closed. The pupils were involved in predicting 
    where they thought the trace would move to as each light was switched on and 
    as each blind was opened. They observed what they called &#8216;a step up&#8217; 
    each time more light was detected by the datalogger. The class then looked 
    at the overnight data and they attempted to explain what had happened. </p>
  <p>The next activity was a &#8216;Living graph&#8217; of the data for the Hall, 
    which followed the same format of the data in the &#8216;A Sense of Murder&#8217; 
    software. The pupils decided which data they would look at, light, sound or 
    temperature; they chose to look at light first. They read the annotation labels 
    which they need to arrange on the graph, for example, &#8216;Door opened&#8217;, 
    &#8216;Light on&#8217;, &#8216;Doorbell rings&#8217;, &#8216;Letter through 
    letterbox&#8217;, &#8216;Dog barks&#8217;. The pupils were allowed thinking 
    time and they discussed with each other their initial ideas. The first pupil 
    came and dragged a label into position on the graph and explained why they 
    had placed it there.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="block">Pupil 1: &#8220;I put the &#8216;Light on&#8217; there on 
      the graph, because you can see it goes up like a step, just like before 
      when you switched on the light in the classroom.&#8221;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The next pupil came and placed the next label on.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="block">Pupil 2: &#8220;I put &#8216;Doorbell rings&#8217; there, 
      because the bell rings first and then they switched the light on and opened 
      the door.&#8221;<br>
      Teacher: &#8220;You story makes sense, but can we tell from the graph? Remember, 
      which data are we looking at?&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 2: &#8220;Light&#8221;<br>
      Teacher: &#8220;So, is there any evidence on this light graph which tells 
      us that the doorbell rang?&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 2; &#8220;Not on this graph, we could look at the sound graph.&#8221;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The activity developed allowing the pupils to place the labels on the different 
    graphs. When this was carried out with a Year 8 class, they were better at 
    focusing on the data than the Year 5 classes. The younger pupils inferred 
    more by the statements than the data, i.e. they sequenced them into a story 
    without looking at the data. So, the activity was turned around. One pupil 
    placed the labels randomly on the graph and the class decided if they could 
    give reasons, based on the information in the graph. They came to the conclusion 
    that if you have the three graphs you can place the labels with supporting 
    evidence, but just looking at one graph means you sometimes need to make up 
    a story. </p>

  </div>
  <p>The pupils took turns to use the dataloggers to look at the light levels 
    around the school and the TV resource, which was part of the software. The 
    pupils pointed the datalogger at the middle of the TV animation on the computer 
    screen and changed the channels on the TV. Once the data was downloaded on 
    to the computer, into the LogIT software, the pupils explained the graph and 
    added annotation labels. This reinforced their learning and provided an assessment 
    for the teacher, showing they had understood the activity.</p>
  <p>The &#8216;A Sense of Murder&#8217; software was started and the teacher 
    discussed what they understood by an alibi. On the computers, the pupils were 
    allowed time to listen to the alibis and look at the light data for the rooms. 
    Finally, for the plenary, the class annotated the light data for the Lounge 
    graph. </p>

      Teacher: &#8220;Why? Is there a part on the graph which matches his alibi?&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 1: &#8220;He says he was watching TV and the light graph jumps up 
      and down like the TV was flickering.&#8221;<br>
      Teacher: &#8220;Put your hands up if you agree&#8230;hands down. OK, hands 
      up if you have a different idea.&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 2: &#8220;I think it was when someone switched on a florescent light, 
      because they flicker on and off, before going on properly.&#8221;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3> <a name="tsl"></a>The Sound lesson</h3>
  <p>The datalogger was recording as the pupils entered the room. The pupils started 
    to notice the trace on the interactive whiteboard reacting vigorously as they 
    settled down into their seats. The trace disappeared below fifty decibels 
    and as the teacher spoke the trace jumped up on the screen; then it was the 
    pupils&#8217; turn. Conducted by the teacher, the class practiced whispering, 
    murmuring, becoming slightly louder into chattering and then a short shout. 
    The graph on the screen reflected the changes in the sound levels, so the 
    pupils came out to annotate the graph with the appropriate words. An emphasis 
    was placed on using accurate language.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="block">Teacher: &#8220;Can you tell me the story of the sound graph?&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 1: &#8220;It is silent then sound gets higher.&#8221;<br>
      Teacher: &#8220;What are the units on the sound graph?&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 2: &#8220;Decibels&#8221;<br>
      Teacher: &#8220;Does that measure how loud or soft a sound is or does it 
      measure how high or low-pitched a sound is?&#8221; &#8220;Hands up for louder 
      and soft&#8230;now, hands up for high and low.&#8221;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In order to check the pupils did not hold a misconception about the loudness 
    of a sound and its pitch, the class were instructed to make a high-pitched 
    sound and then a low-pitched sound at around 90 decibels. Then they made high 
    and low-pitched sounds at around 60 decibels.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="block">Teacher: &#8220;When the line on the graph goes down from 
      90 to 60 decibels, is the pitch of the sound changing?<br>
      Pupil 3: &#8220;We can&#8217;t tell, because the graph just tells us how 
      loud the sounds are.&#8221;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The class thought of places where you might need a sound sensor. They suggested 
    a monitoring system for a classroom to judge when a class is being too noisy. 
  </p>
  <p>The pupils started the &#8216;A Sense of Murder&#8217; software and continued 
    to solve the crime. The pupils with the datalogger used the &#8216;Radio&#8217; 
    part of the software. By holding the sensor next to the computer&#8217;s speakers, 
    the pupils recorded the sound levels for the different radio stations on the 
    virtual radio. They then annotated the graph to identify when the radio station 
    was playing Rock music (loud), Dance music (repetitive beat) or a comedy programme 
    (from quiet to loud when the audience laughs). </p>

  </div>
  <p>The activities were closely related to the alibis of the suspects. Therefore, 
    the pupils were able to match the patterns from the sound graphs of the datalogger 
    to the graphs in the different rooms in the software.</p>
  <h3> <a name="ttl"></a>The Temperature lesson</h3>
  <p>The lesson began with the class looking at the temperature trace from the 
    datalogger which had been collecting overnight. The pupils described the story 
    of the graph as the temperature dropped and rose again when the school heating 
    was switched on. They were then asked to predict what would happen if the 
    temperature sensor was placed into a flask of hot water, which was boiled 
    an hour before.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="block">Pupil 1: &#8220;The line on the graph would go up.&#8221;<br>
      Teacher: &#8220;What would happen if I didn&#8217;t place the sensor in 
      the water, but placed it above the water?&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 2: &#8220;It would go up, but not as much as if you&#8217;d put it 
      in the water.&#8221;<br>
      Teacher: &#8220;OK, then, come and draw on the whiteboard the line you think 
      the temperature trace will follow.&#8221;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The pupils drew their lines and the datalogger was placed above the hot water. 
    The class watched and evaluated whether their predictions were correct. Then 
    they predicted the graph shape for placing the sensor in front of a fan heater 
    and out of the window.</p>
  <div class="centered"> 
    <table class="centered-table" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
      <tr> 
        <td><img src="bunce/image017.jpg" alt="Annotating the temperature graph" title="Annotating the temperature graph"width="302" height="227"></td>
        <td><img src="bunce/image018.jpg" alt="Measuring the temperature" title="Measuring the temperature"width="171" height="229"></td>

      <tr> 
        <td>Annotating the temperature graph</td>
        <td>Measuring the temperature</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>The next activity involved the pupils using the virtual kettle (part of the 
    software). The animated kettle boiled onscreen and the simulated temperature 
    data was plotted on the graph. The animation was paused and the pupils were 
    again asked to discuss and predict the shape of the graph as the kettle reached 
    boiling point. </p>
  <div class="centered"> 
    <table class="centered-table" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
      <tr> 
        <td><img src="bunce/image019.jpg" alt="Where do you think the graph will go?" title="Where do you think the graph will go?" width="300" height="226"></td>
        <td><img src="bunce/image020.jpg" alt="The virtual kettle" title="The virtual kettle"width="308" height="231"></td>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
        <td>Where do you think the graph will go?</td>
        <td>The virtual kettle</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>The class continued to solve the murder case, matching the temperature data 
    to the suspects&#8217; alibis.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="block">Teacher: &#8220;When the character says &#8216;it&#8217;s 
      freezing&#8217; is there any evidence in the graph?&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 1: &#8220;It&#8217;s freezing&#8230;it&#8217;s a turn of phrase, it&#8217;s 
      not really that cold&#8221; <br>
      Teacher: &#8220;What temperature do you think the room would be if it was 
      freezing?&#8221;<br>
      Pupil 2: &#8220;Zero Celsius&#8221;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3><a name="tfl"></a>The final lesson, investigating sampling rates</h3>
  <p>The pupils now were at the stage of having a solution to the crime. They 
    had analysed to data and matched it to the suspects&#8217; alibis. So before 
    the conclusion of the topic, the concept of sampling rates was considered.</p>
  <p>From the software, &#8216;The Jewel Thief&#8217; activity was projected onto 
    the whiteboard. The scenario was a museum containing a special jewel, which 
    was watched over by security cameras. The cameras could only store a limited 
    number of frames, so the pupils discussed between themselves about how often 
    they wanted to take a picture. If they captured too often, they could run 
    out of pictures, if the intervals were too large, they could miss the thief 
    entering. The quality of their ideas and explanations were excellent, it clearly 
    showed the development of their questioning and collaborative skills over 
    the lessons. </p>
  <div class="centered"> 
    <table class="centered-table" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
      <tr> 
        <td><img src="bunce/image021.jpg" alt="The Jewel Thief" title="The Jewel Thief"width="305" height="229"></td>
        <td><img src="bunce/image022.jpg" alt="Watching the detectives" title="Watching the detectives"width="305" height="230"></td>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
        <td>The Jewel Thief</td>
        <td>Watching the detectives</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>The class then considered monitoring different scenarios and decided upon 
    which sensors would be most appropriate and suitable sampling rates. This 
    enabled them to construct experiments for each other, which they would investigate 
    in future lessons. </p>
  <p>Finally, the whole class deliberated on the alibis and the data to solve 
    the crime. Again, the precise language they used and the interpretation skills 
    they displayed showed that they had developed their abilities over the lessons 
    and most notably enjoyed themselves. Eventually, they discovered that the 
    murderer was&#8230;arrrggh! Thud!</p>
