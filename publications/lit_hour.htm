  <p>Most schools in England are running a daily Literacy Hour - a strategy designed 
    to raise standards of literacy and with a target of 80% of 11 year olds reaching 
    level 4 in Key Stage 2 SATs in 2002. <a name="Why ICT"></a>But how does ICT 
    fit in to all this? There is currently a great deal of government and media 
    hype about it. More and more technology is being installed in schools in order 
    to enskill the children of the new millennium. It is interesting, therefore, 
    to note that apart from a few passing references to <em>word-processing</em> 
    and <em>CD-ROMS, </em>there is surprisingly little reference in the National 
    Literacy Strategy Framework of Objectives to the use of ICT in the Literacy 
    Hour. Why this omission? Well, the introduction of something as radical as 
    the Literacy Hour is bound to create management and resource issues for many 
    teachers and schools. Adding a computer, with all its technical foibles, into 
    the equation might just prove to be the final straw. However, to leave out 
    ICT would be to do a disservice to an amazingly motivating and versatile tool. 
    The National Literacy Association ran the Docklands Learning Acceleration 
    Project which worked with six hundred 7 and 8 year olds in school and at home. 
    It proved that using multi-media and portable technology, as well as more 
    traditional methods, could raise standards and expectations of children's 
    literacy. The largest, most innovative ICT project of its time, the Docklands' 
    schools encountered many of the problems that will arise when introducing 
    technology into the primary classroom ... 
  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>There isn't the time.</em></strong></li>
    <li><em><strong>No more money to replace the colour printer ink.</strong></em></li>
    <li><em><strong>I'm technophobic.</strong></em></li>
    <li><em><strong>How will I know that my children aren't just playing about?</strong></em></li>
    <li><em><strong>It's not working.</strong></em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>... and tackled them head on. Now we know the <em>Yes buts</em> ... and they're 
    the same when anything new is introduced (after all, does anyone remember 
    language masters?) ... and found some, if not all, of the answers. So, before 
    you wheel the computer trolley back into the security cupboard, and give the 
    batteries from your portable machines back to the science co-ordinator, have 
    a look at some of the ways in which schools working with the National Literacy 
    Association Projects team have incorporated technology into their group work 
    activities in the Literacy Hour. </p>
  <p><a name="ts-level"></a><strong>Text and Sentence-level</strong> <br>
    Work A Year 3 class had been exploring traditional stories in Shared Reading. 
    In their group work, using a letter template stored on a portable computer, 
    the children wrote to a chosen character, responding to aspects of the text 
    and giving reasons for their opinions, Objective Y3 T2 T2, 7. </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Dear ...</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>I was sad when ...</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>because ...</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>I was pleased when ...</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>although ...</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>I was angry when ...</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>however ...</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>Now I think you should ...</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>so that ...</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>With best wishes ...</em></strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The first drafts were printed out and edited with a writing partner. They 
    used the Thesaurus to change words such as <em>pleased</em> and <em>angry</em> 
    to <em>delighted</em> and <em>fuming, </em>Y3 T2 W17. They discussed appropriate 
    endings for particular sorts of letters - would you write <em>with best wishes</em>, 
    <em>yours sincerely</em> or <em>with lots of love</em> if you were writing 
    to the Big Bad Wolf? This work also enabled the children to explore the use 
    of first and third person pronouns as included at Y3 T2 S10. The final version 
    was presented using a Clip Art computer graphic. Writing frames set up on 
    portables and computers provide generic activities which can be related to 
    the class books and can be developed from the Shared Reading session. They 
    are easily used by children in their groups; they can use a spell check and 
    Thesaurus facility and so they can work independently. The edited drafts provide 
    an ideal discussion focus for the Plenary session. Tried and tested picture 
    books can be a valuable resource at all levels. For example, one Year 3 class 
    looked at the story of <em>Not Now Bernard</em> by David McKee, Y3 T2 T3, 
    8, 17. The class used a Wanted Report writing frame to hunt the monster. This 
    required close observation of the text, but also the children had to invent 
    some aspects needing informed guesses and some discussion - how old do you 
    think that monster was? They downloaded their first draft onto a computer 
    graphic and edited this with a writing partner, using a talking word processor 
    which enabled them to hear what they had written for editing. Other activities 
    that week included writing in character as an Agony Aunty, giving advice to 
    Bernard about his relationship with his parents, completing a sequel and retelling 
    the story from the monsters point of view. A child with learning difficulties 
    used the teacher's typed text of <em>Not Now Bernard</em> and employed the 
    computer's <em>Search</em> and <em>Replace </em>facility to change character 
    and setting. This gave him a solid scaffold on which to work and he was thrilled 
    with his results. Opportunities for this type of work occur at all ages and 
    stages, e.g. Y5 T3 T3 focuses on retelling from a different point of view 
    or perspective. Children are encouraged, throughout the Framework document 
    to e.g. 'record their feelings, reflections and predictions about a book' 
    Y5 T1 T13 - otherwise known as a book review. In order to provide some variety 
    in what might generally be seen as a very boring activity, we have looked 
    at ways of adapting the Database packages for computers and portables, for 
    example to compare books by the same author (Y2 T3 T4); to explore recurring 
    themes in books from other cultures (Y4 T3 T2) and to compare and contrast 
    points of view and reactions to stories (Y5 T3 T7). </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>What type of story?</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>What characters?</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>What were they like?</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>Where?</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>When?</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>An event.</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>The problem.</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>The solution.</em></strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this way children can become experts in their own right on some area of 
    an author or a subject. Others in the class can ask them to recommend a book 
    or tell them where the best place to find one is. Children are more in control 
    of their own learning and so make the management of the group time much easier 
    for the teacher to handle. A Year 4 class explored text level objectives Y4 
    T1 T1, 2 following a Shared Reading of the first chapters of <em>The Bears 
    on Hemlock Mountain</em>, by Alice Dalgleish. Using a writing frame they explored 
    the character and text, predicting what they thought would happen. They were 
    completely wrong. This made them keen to go back and complete their book review 
    to put the record straight. <em>Talking Books</em> provide an excellent group 
    activity to follow up the teacher's Shared Reading input, and there are many 
    of these available on the market. These have an audio facility and particularly 
    help children who are finding reading difficult. Children can go back and 
    interrogate the text, look up words in a dictionary and carry out the exercises 
    on screen which these software packages contain. These books are a great motivational 
    resource for children who are having difficulty with reading. Children can 
    access stories that are above their actual reading level; they can participate 
    actively in the Plenary Session, because that they will have read the book, 
    and have understood what they have read. </p>
  <p><a name="Non-fiction"></a><strong>Non-fiction</strong> <br>
    A Year 4 class began their topic on Ancient Greeks by appraising the content 
    of the non-fiction books in their class for their usefulness (Y4 T2 T15) in 
    finding out about Greek schools. Again the introduction for the week was the 
    Shared Reading session and the work naturally grew out of this. In groups, 
    the children began by identifying key facts in one article, drawing pictograms 
    to represent each fact (Y4 T2 T18). Using their pictures, the children recorded 
    their facts on a spreadsheet, paraphrasing the information in note form. They 
    then compared the facts they had found in their first extract with another, 
    more complicated article from another source. Having completed their findings, 
    the children printed out their spreadsheet and decided which of the two information 
    sources had been the most useful in providing the information they needed 
    for their topic work. Another group, researching the Roman invasions, took 
    the use of technology one stage further. The children posed themselves two 
    questions - were the countries further away from Rome occupied for less time 
    than those nearer? Why did the Romans stay so much longer in some countries? 
    The children used a variety of CD-ROMS, maps and books to complete a database 
    then used this information to plot 2 graphs, in order to find out answers 
    to their questions. On their portable computers they posed a series of questions 
    for their classmates to answer. Questioning skills are central to children 
    working independently. How do they know what they are looking for? How do 
    they know how much information will be needed? The computer had now become 
    a complete resource, holding all the information needed in one format or another 
    to answer the questions. </p>
  <p><a name="w-level"></a><strong>Word-level Work</strong><br>
    Much of the Word-level work in the group-work time will be given to children 
    in the form of worksheets. These will develop the idea of the first thirty 
    minutes - picking out a particular phonic pattern perhaps, looking at the 
    peculiarities of word building - do you drop the 'e' when you add 'ing', etc.? 
    However many worksheets merely ask children to write in letters and children 
    soon get wise to this. Pictures are not all they seem. A child, writing in 
    the final consonant sounds of can and pin, thought the pictures were of a 
    nail and of cat food. But she still wrote the correct answer. Where is the 
    learning? Using a multimedia spelling package - and there are many about - 
    gives children access to sound. They can hear the word. They can click on 
    it and hear it again. They can click on the separate onsets and rimes. They 
    can click on pictures and be told what they really are. Most packages ensure 
    that children actually place the letters in a particular order, thus promoting 
    a multi sensory approach to spelling. Children can also find out their scores 
    and often print out the words they could not spell. The teacher therefore 
    has a record of exactly what the child is doing. On the Pocket Book computers 
    we use in schools there is a fantastic program called Spell. Basically a spell 
    check, it also has an anagram and crossword facility. This enables children 
    to investigate word patterns for themselves, generating words for spelling 
    logs and class word banks, for example at Y1 T2 W3. We have seen positive 
    results when children have used the spell check and thesaurus facilities collaboratively. 
    These are often easier for children to use than a traditional dictionary. 
    If they have spelt a word incorrectly a series of phonetically similar words 
    is presented to them, e.g. did they want to write, <em>cut, cup, cat, cap</em>? 
    They have to read, discriminate and choose. Children become more aware of 
    their own spelling errors, beginning to spot patterns in the mistakes they 
    make - <em>'I forgot to double the 'p' again.' </em>rather than just <em>'I 
    got it wrong.' </em> </p>
  <p><strong>The <a name="internet"></a>Internet </strong><br>
    The C in ICT stands for communication and the Internet is an ideal tool for 
    allowing children to communicate. It provides a real audience and an almost 
    immediate response to their written communication. It is strange therefore 
    that it should be best known as an information medium; it is often compared 
    to a library, and indeed it is, but you would not allow a child to enter the 
    British Library with just the instruction 'Find out about volcanoes'. Many 
    children are given simple instructions like this and told to 'surf the net'. 
    Watch them. Like surfers, they bounce from wave to wave, they click from page 
    to page. Of course, not a great deal happens, but you can guarantee that a 
    piece of paper will emerge from the printer - containing somebody else's words. 
    There is no research focus, there is no structure or purpose to the learning. 
    We ought to be thinking in terms of 'mining the net', i.e. really getting 
    below the surface with a purpose in mind, equipped with correct and appropriate 
    tools. The Internet is a huge publishing house. How many children can have 
    their work published internationally and receive back comments from anywhere 
    in the world? It is motivational as long as it has a purpose and a response. 
    It is notoriously difficult to read a web page, so why should children read 
    it? We have been working with Education Extra and magazine publishers to use 
    sport on the Internet as a focus for interesting children in literacy activities 
    - particularly boys. Children are given the opportunity to write to their 
    favourite football stars and receive e-mails back. They are asked to extract 
    information from football match reports on screen, after hearing difficult 
    words and investigating the screen dictionary, and to reformat the information 
    from their own point of view. They can then send this electronically to publishers 
    who will choose the best report to print in their favourite team's programme 
    - as well as being published on the web. In this way, traditional literacy 
    activities to involve children with language will be enthusiastically tackled. 
    The material is constantly changing, but can be printed out for paper-based 
    activity. In all, we are using the medium as a truly interactive communication 
    medium for young people, providing them with an experience they can get nowhere 
    else, all the time focusing on the language as well as the content. Consider 
    the language possibilities of only one sentence: <em>Berger turned provider 
    to feed Fowler and the England striker struck a powerful deflected left foot 
    shot into the far corner.</em> It's close to poetry. </p>
  <p><a name="management"></a><strong>Management Issues</strong> <br>
    Of course, using ICT highlights management issues to be dealt with. There 
    is nothing more frustrating to child and teacher when, after much hard effort 
    a piece of work is completed, only to find that the printer won't print it 
    out. Be prepared for things to go wrong, because they do and will. Here are 
    a few guidelines from our experience: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Have a back-up activity ready in cases of total malfunction. </li>
    <li>Deal with printer problems outside the teaching time - as long as the 
      work is saved it can be printed out at a later date. </li>
    <li>Log all technical problems; ignoring them doesn't mean they will go away.</li>
    <li>Find out the school's policy for maintenance and ensure that the problems 
      are addressed. You do not mend your own washing machine when it goes wrong. 
      Neither should you be expected to mend computers.</li>
    <li>Check peripherals, e.g. printer ink, mouse connections, volume controls, 
      on a regular basis.</li>
    <li>Familiarise yourself with the programs on which the children will be working. 
      Often things haven't gone 'wrong', but something unexpected has happened 
      to panic the less ICT confident teacher.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>
  <p>You might ask why use computers? All the activities can all be done using 
    pen and paper. Yes they can, but what we need to establish is whether ICT 
    is the most effective tool for the task. Ask yourself the four 'e's. Does 
    ICT: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>ease and support the task in hand?</li>
    <li>enable the learner?</li>
    <li>ensure that learning outcomes can be achieved?</li>
    <li>enhance the quality and value of the task?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If it doesn't, then don't use it. We have found that using ICT in the Literacy 
    Hour can: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>provide a change of approach to tried and tested ideas </li>
    <li>offer structure and support for less able children</li>
    <li>extend those at the top end </li>
    <li>give new insight to vocabulary and word work, </li>
    <li>show children a more positive approach to drafting and editing</li>
    <li>motivate and encourage a fresh response to the skills of reading and writing. 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>So, don't put your computers away. You can use them in the Literacy Hour.
