  <h2>David Baugh</h2>
  <p><em>Fellow</em></p>
  <p><img src="../images/DBaugh.JPG" width="200" height="183" align="right">From 
    the outset I want to express my support for the thinking that brought both 
    the Teaching Awards and the BECTa ICT in Practice awards into being. Teachers 
    should get recognition for the work they do and all in education realise that 
    there are thousands of brilliant teachers out there. In my opinion, they should 
    all get the public recognition they deserve and it is this that makes me a 
    little uneasy about the recognition I have received. There are teachers in 
    my own school that are worthy of national recognition and I hope they are 
    willing to be nominated this year. What I am really trying to say is that 
    I don&#8217;t feel that I am special and am slightly embarrassed about the 
    success, which is in great part due to the team I work with. 
  <p>So what were the judges looking for? Both awards had similar objectives on 
    paper by looking for teachers who were by their use of ICT able to have a 
    real impact on their pupils, peers and the wider community. In reality, I 
    think the two organisations had different agendas with the Teaching Awards 
    looking for teachers who were a little bit different and with BECTa looking 
    for replicable good practice. Neither of these are a perfect way of choosing 
    winners but I suppose the judges had to make some tough decisions.</p>
  <p>How then did I fit the bill? I think was in part due to my passion for ICT 
    transform education and my eternal optimism. With all the cynicism and suspicion 
    of change there is in the profession a bit of optimism goes a long way. I 
    work in the worst funded LEA in Wales which lags some 5% behind the funding 
    in England. We receive one quarter of the NGfL funding that a comparable LEA 
    would across the border. My solution to this was to scrounge and enlist the 
    parents in networking of the school. We ended up with 32 networked computers 
    for nothing. The real challenge should have been how to get everyone using 
    the computers productively but it wasn&#8217;t. Quite early on in my teaching 
    career I discovered the power of multimedia as a tool for the children to 
    use to express themselves and it was this that the staff took up with great 
    zeal. I have become disaffected with children using ICT passively with so 
    called interactive multimedia programmes and with teachers endlessly using 
    ICT to test children. So I have concentrated on using ICT to be creative and 
    tried to encourage children to be investigative and analytical.</p>
  <p>These are easy words to write but how can it happen in practice. An example 
    of ICT transforming teaching arose by accident really. We were investigating 
    air resistance by dropping different types of parachutes and trying to time 
    their fall to the ground &#8211; you know the type of thing. The children 
    were having the usual problems with accuracy using stopwatches. I asked some 
    of the children to make a record of the investigation by filming the investigation 
    with a DV Camera. They started to make the film and then showed me how they 
    could time the parachutes on the computer by cutting the video in the right 
    places. They could also make more accurate observation with the video by seeing 
    exactly how the parachutes fell and put this together to present their results. 
    To me this was real independent investigation that wasn&#8217;t possible without 
    ICT and transformed the way we worked in the classroom. Other projects we 
    have done using video and multimedia are similar in the way they can liberate 
    learning from some of the rather stilted paper based projects I have devised 
    in the past.</p>
  <p>The judges spent about three days in my classroom, which was not as daunting 
    as it may sound as they were put to work! The children were engaged on the 
    type of projects explained above doing all types of subjects and importantly 
    being productive. This meant my classroom was as chaotic as ever but something 
    seemed to click with the judges &#8211; they enjoyed it too.</p>
  <p>I hope you find this useful and gives you some sort of insight into the awards 
    from a winners perspective.</p>
