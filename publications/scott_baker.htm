    Primary Curriculum Exchange between US and UK</strong> </h2>
  <p><em>MirandaNet fellows, Marion and Geoff Scott-Baker have recently completed 
    a primary curriculum exchange between the US and UK. Read about their experiences 
    here. </em> 
  <p>The autumn sun was still low in the sky, adding depth of colour to the thick 
    blanket of red and yellow leaves that lay in front of the long low, grey single 
    story building of my exchange school in Rhode Island USA. An Elementary School 
    consisting of 250 students from Pre-Kindergarten to Grade 8 (Year 9) run by 
    12 teaching staff and a number of ancillaries.</p>
  <p>For the past four years we had been exchanging project work with the first 
    and fourth year pupils here, and at last I was about to meet the staff and 
    children who up to now had only been names on drawings, essays and emails. 
    As Beverly - my contact in Rhode Island whom I had just met for the first 
    time the day before - drove us up to the school it could easily have been 
    the start of any academic day in the UK. Parents arrived in cars and four-wheel 
    drives, children bundled out carrying all their paraphernalia for the day, 
    and shouts of 'don't forget to.' and 'picking you up at.' rang across the 
    forecourt. Only the fact that the vehicles were on the 'wrong' side of the 
    road and carried colourful Rhode Island number plates gave the game away, 
    that we were in fact 3000 miles from home. And the school would never need 
    to worry about attracting more pupils every year as Rhode Island state law 
    gave it a strictly defined clientele that was dictated by geography and statute 
    rather than parental choice.</p>
  <p>As well as making the acquaintance of the children who had so far known me 
    only as 'the teacher from England' I had also been asked to read a chapter 
    from one of the Harry Potter books. In addition, as we were nearing Guy Fawkes 
    Day in England, I had brought along some information about the gunpowder plot, 
    and had made a book containing material provided by members of my class at 
    Cheam. I had asked my children to give me essays and pictures on whatever 
    part of their lives that were most important to them. As a momentary diversion, 
    the collation of this book met with as much enthusiasm from the children's 
    parents as it did from the children themselves. The result was a thick document 
    on A2 paper covering everything from the stunning views out of a holiday cottage 
    window to a child's pride at living in a house dating from the Tudor period. 
    The readings and the book went down extremely well but the story of Guy Fawkes 
    and his gang met with less enthusiasm as the American children found it difficult 
    to relate to a plot against a political system that was so different from 
    their own. Emphasised to some extent by the fact that none of the children 
    I asked had any concept of where Great Britain was or even how small it is 
    compared to the United States. You may be pleased to know that we are located 
    somewhere between Canada and New Zealand, though nobody actually placed us 
    in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
  <p>My first reading was with Beverly's class - Grade 4 - and it proved to be 
    a two way learning experience but not in the way I had anticipated. One of 
    the mistakes that we make as Britons when visiting America is to assume that 
    because we appear to understand each other there is no need for any kind of 
    translation, whether verbal or literal. I was therefore surprised to find 
    myself reading words such as trunk, windshield and highway instead of boot, 
    windscreen and road. This book that I thought would be so familiar to me as 
    I opened the page to chapter two suddenly took on the dimensions of a foreign 
    translation. As I read it struck me that perhaps we could turn this into a 
    mutual awareness session so I began to change some of the words into their 
    British English forms. I paused from time to time whenever one of these 'foreign' 
    translations arose to show the children that we are indeed two nations separated 
    by a common language. We even raised the important difference in the use of 
    'pavement' which in the UK is something we walk on whereas in America it is 
    their word for road. Could you imagine the disastrous consequences of an English 
    teacher telling an American child to always walk on the pavement between home 
    and school? The readings went well and one of the more amusing pieces of feedback 
    was that my characterisations were 'just like the tape' where the characters 
    'sounded as they should', i.e. with an English accent. The teacher agreed 
    with the class that they would try harder to make their readings of the book 
    more authentic - unfortunately we didn't hear the results of their linguistic 
    quest. </p>
  <p>This was only one of my curriculum adventures where I found so many of my 
    professional assumptions challenged. I had not expected to find so much that 
    was totally different in a country where so much of the research we value 
    and quote from takes place. I am anxious to spend longer there to observe 
    rather than teach and to share experiences and opinions with the staff there. 
    Beverly and I talked far into the night for the two nights that we stayed 
    and I left feeling that we were really &quot;kindred spirits&quot; (Anne of 
    Green Gables) with so much to share and learn from each other. And hopefully 
    this is the start of many trips in both directions for us.</p>
  <p>It was a wonderful visit and I would encourage you to do the same if you 
    can possibly set up a relationship with a school abroad - thank you Beverly!</p>
