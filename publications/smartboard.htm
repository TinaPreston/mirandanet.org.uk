  <h3><a name="ABSTRACT"></a>Abstract</h3>
  <p>This paper examines the ways in which the Whiteboard technology was integrated 
    into a numbers of areas in the curriculum during the first half of the Summer 
    term, 2000.</p>
  <p>Teachers who volunteered to pilot the technology received minimal training. 
    The technology was applied to existing lesson plans, used with existing software 
    and the Internet and evaluated in terms of the learning and motivational gains 
    of the students.</p>
  <p>Staff and 78% of students reported improvements in motivation. All staff 
    thought the Whiteboard was effective in terms of learning gains and 11% thought 
    it was essential for their learning outcome to be achieved.</p>
  <p>Most were enthusiastic about the Whiteboard and all were impressed by its 
    ease of use.</p>
  <h3><a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>Introduction and Background</h3>
    <p><strong>Proposals</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>To look at a variety of applications within the learning environment across 
      the curriculum.</li>
    <li>To see how much teacher time is involved in the set up of lessons.</li>
    <li>To look at the contribution to effective learning.</li>
    <li>To look at the interactive nature of the Whiteboard and its use as more 
      than a glorified chalkboard.</li>
    <li>Use as a tool for staff training in the use of ICT e.g. implications for 
      ICT competencies for NQTs in Sept 2000 and eventually all staff.</li>
    <li>Is it a cost effective resource in terms of use with a projector or a 
      liquid crystal tablet mounted on an overhead projector.</li>
    <li>Practicalities of use within a school; rooming, setting up the projector, 
      ICT technician support.</li>
  </ul>
    <p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
  <p>Staff in different departments, after training, trial the use of the Whiteboard 
    in their lessons.</p>
    <p><strong>Report and Evaluation</strong></p>
  <p>Case study reporting on the effectiveness of the learning, the opportunities 
    for interaction with students and the amount of teacher time involved during 
    the preparation of the lessons. Questionnaire to support this. Once the lesson 
    has been set up will the majority of the preparation have been done?</p>

  <h3><a name="METHODOLOGY"></a>Methodology</h3>
  <p>The Whiteboard was used with a LCD projector and a LCD tablet for an overhead 
    projector. The ICT technician Tim Harrison was responsible for the set-up 
    of the board, the use of the software to make the board interactive and the 
    set-up of the projector. All staff who used the board had minimal input into 
    the practicalities of its use, arriving in the room with a fully functioning 
    board ready for use.</p>
  <p>The Whiteboard was used in a variety of rooms, all of which were equipped 
    with PCs. The board was not used in an ordinary classroom. All rooms were 
    very light and had no curtains to black out the room so the use of the LCD 
    OHP tablet was problematic. The LCD projector was used subject to availability.</p>
  <p>Staff who had booked computer lessons were approached and asked if they were 
    willing to trial the Whiteboard and spend a few minutes evaluating its use 
    by filling in a questionnaire. I tried to include a variety of staff from 
    different departments and to get an equal gender bias.</p>
  <p>The questionnaire tried to address a variety of possible problems and outcomes. 
    There were three parts to the questionnaire:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>looking at the first contact with the Whiteboard and how easy was it to 
      use;</li>
    <li>the preparation for the lesson;</li>
    <li>the lesson itself.</li>
    <li>Evaluation of the lesson asked a variety of questions:</li>
    <li>how valuable a resource was the Whiteboard;</li>
    <li>would it be used on a regular basis;</li>
    <li>what about the learning and motivational outcomes for students?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some students were interviewed about their experiences of the lesson.</p>
  <p>Staff from a variety of departments and with varying levels of ICT competence 
    used the board in a variety of different ways with students of different ages 
    and abilities.</p>
  <p>Tim Harrison was responsible for the set up of the Whiteboard and making 
    sure it was in working order for the lesson to begin. This meant that staff 
    were able to come to the lesson with everything set up with no hassle for 
    them ready to start teaching.</p>
  <p>This was vital to the confidence of staff some of whom were unsure about 
    being able to utilise the technology. Tim gave 3 out of 10 for ease of initial 
    set-up and 3 out of 10 for time to set-up the Whiteboard, there were also 
    lots of leads involved and these were stretched across the room. He thought 
    it very easy to actually use and excellent in terms of its reliability. Portability 
    was a problem but it wasn't designed to be moved. The projector was used successfully 
    but the room had to be totally blacked out to use with the LCD OHP tablet. 
    Overall Tim didn't think it would be of enough benefit to justify the expense 
    of the Whiteboard, the cost of a PC and the cost of a projector.</p>

  <h3><a name="PREPARATIONS"></a>Preparations</h3>
  <p>The Whiteboard was used with both an LCD projector and an LCD tablet for 
    overhead projector. The ICT technician Tim Harrison was responsible for the 
    set-up of the board, the use of the software to make the board interactive 
    and the set-up of the projector. All staff who used the board had minimal 
    input into the practicalities of its use, arriving in the room with a fully 
    functioning board ready for use.</p>
  <p>The Whiteboard was used in a variety of rooms, all of which were equipped

  <h3>Results of <a name="QUESTIONNAIRE"></a>Questionnaire</h3>
  <p>Staff were asked to complete an evaluation of the lesson involving the Whiteboard 
    a summary of which appears <a href="#Summary">below</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Initial use</strong></p>
    <p><em>First Impressions.</em></p>
  <p>Most first impressions were positive. Staff thought the Whiteboard was easy 
    to use and the software worked exactly as it was supposed to. They were very 
    impressed by the &quot;wow&quot; factor and how impressive it would be to 
    a class of students. A very good way to present information as it kept the 
    attention by the constant movement of the image. One staff response was &quot;cool&quot;! 
    Staff thought the possibilities seemed vast.</p>
  <p>The only negative comments were about the amount of room taken up by the 
    projector and the computer with the Whiteboard software in a limited space 
    and too much light in the room as a consequence of having no blinds making 
    the image difficult to see. The booking of the projector or LCD tablet could 
    be a problem.</p>
    <p><em>Time taken to familiarise with use of the board.</em></p>
  <p>All staff said that the Whiteboard was extremely user friendly, easy to use 
    and took them between five to ten minutes to feel confident enough to use 
    it in the classroom.</p>
    <p><em>Problems</em></p>
  <p>The only problem encountered was when the projector used to project the image 
    on to the screen was moved the calibration of the screen altered as the active 
    points on the board shift.</p>
    <p><em>Potential annoyances</em></p>
  <p>There were a variety of problems which staff could foresee. One mentioned 
    earlier of the Whiteboard moving as it was quite light and would alter the 
    sensitivity of the board so the cursor was not as accurate. The flex between 
    computer and board and computer and projector could be a potential for problems 
    with both staff moving around near the board and tripping over the flex and 
    students moving around within the room and not being as careful as they should 
    be. Students could both knock the projector and board or trip on the flex. 
    Standing in the beam of the projector and casting a shadow was also a concern, 
    although this could be avoided with practice at using a board. The pens were 
    not smooth or accurate enough for writing on the board only for circling or 
    highlighting pertinent features.</p>
    <p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
    <p><em>Software Used</em></p>
  <p>Staff used a variety of software.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A staff training session used Netscape Communicator to teach the construction 
      of a new page on our Intranet.</li>
    <li>Another staff training session showed staff how to incorporate the Internet 
      into their lessons.</li>
    <li>A year 9 group had a session on the use of the Internet for research.</li>
    <li>A year 9 group was shown how to use the existing Maths software on angles.</li>
    <li>A year 7 group was shown how to use Excel and a group spreadsheet of data 
      was produced amalgamating all their results for manipulation.</li>
    <li>Power point was used with a sixth form group to present the key points 
      of a lesson.</li>
    <li>A year 8 group used the Internet and Word to import information from the 
      Net into Word for printing.</li>
    <li>A CD-ROM, Encarta was used with a year 8 group.</li>
  </ul>
    <p><em>Preparation Time</em></p>
  <p>Preparation time for staff was minimal: nobody spent more than an hour in 
    preparation as most staff used existing software.</p>
    <p><em>Ease of set up before lesson.</em></p>
  <p>Staff did not have the problem of setting up the Whiteboard as we have the 
    services of an excellent ICT technician. Staff were able to walk into the 
    room and start the lesson with confidence.</p>
  <p>Most staff used the projector with the Whiteboard, as we have no blinds with 
    which to black out rooms. The LCD tablet did not produce a strong enough image 
    to be seen clearly.</p>
    <p><strong>Lesson</strong></p>
    <p><em>Did it work?</em></p>
  <p>Yes.</p>
    <p><em>Difficulties?</em></p>
  <p>No one reported any problems.</p>
    <p><em>Comments.</em></p>
  <p>Most staff thought that it was a useful tool. Classes were enthusiastic and 
    positive about the use of the Whiteboard. The fact that it is large and has 
    a clear display that is easily to manipulate makes the board a focal point. 
    Key points of lessons could be picked up quickly, the lessons were clear and 
    dynamic (the teacher wasn't running round 15 machines showing individuals 
    what to do). In the case of setting up a spreadsheet the students could see 
    what their spreadsheet should contain and look like, could follow instructions 
    by watching the use of the hand as a mouse rather than having to listen, understand 
    and interpret a spoken or written instruction. One member of staff reported 
    the lesson being better than anticipated, students were aware of the novelty 
    value, but were able to proceed with the lesson.</p>
  <p>Some staff were positive about the Whiteboard's role as a demonstration tool 
    but did not see benefits in all their ICT teaching.</p>
    <p><em>How valuable a resource was the Whiteboard within this lesson?</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>No one thought the Whiteboard was of no use.</li>
    <li>33% thought it was of some use.</li>
    <li>56% thought it was very useful.</li>
    <li>11% couldn't have done the lesson without it as the lesson was built around 
      the use of the board.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The interactive aspect of the Whiteboard was welcomed with students able 
    to come out and demonstrate to the class. The use as a demonstration tool 
    was considered important; students could see exactly what the screen should 
    look like. It made demonstrations a lot easier rather than having to go from 
    PC to PC to show individuals this saved time and allowed staff to spend time 
    discussing other aspects of the work. The large display and the ability to 
    annotate the screen were very useful.</p>
    <p><em>Would you use the Whiteboard on a regular basis?</em></p>
  <p>67% of users would want to use the whiteboard on a regular basis if the projector 
    was available and there was a dedicated room.</p>
    <p><em>How effective was the Whiteboard in terms of student learning?</em></p>
  <p>The majority of staff thought the Whiteboard was effective in students learning. 
    Students that were spoken to were very positive about their learning outcomes 
    and enjoyed the lessons. The Whiteboard was clear to use and see the work 
    had more impact, in the case of staff, the groups were totally focussed on 
    the trainer and the screen. Staff were also very keen to have a go themselves, 
    as were plenty of students. Staff found it far easier to communicate their 
    ideas to a large group and for them to fully understand. Students were able 
    to see what they had to do rather than follow verbal instruction.</p>
    <p><em>How effective was it at motivating the students?</em></p>
  <p>78% thought the students were very motivated by the Whiteboard. In one lesson 
    the students were very excited and really got involved with enthusiasm, they 
    all wanted to touch the board. Students thought it was &quot;cool&quot;. When 
    students were spoken to they all enjoyed the lessons and said they had been 
    motivated. They liked the large image and the visual aspect of their learning. 
    Why did students respond positively when asked about their own motivation?</p>
  <p>There perhaps might be the danger of losing interest once students became 
    used to the board and it not being the motivating influence it once was. This 
    could perhaps be the focus for further study.</p>
    <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
  <p>Staff liked the idea that they appeared to be at the cutting edge of technology 
    and students were impressed by the use of the Whiteboard. The Whiteboard was 
    quick to learn to use; points could be highlighted using the pens. Windows 
    could be used the same as with an ordinary computer. The clarity and interest 
    as a demonstration tool impressed most staff. The Whiteboard enabled staff 
    to keep the class together, direct tasks and provided a focal point for students 
    who weren't quite as computer literate as others. Students could take an active 
    part in class teaching by coming up and demonstrating to the whole class and 
    gained confidence in their skills by doing so. The Whiteboard allowed demonstration 
    to a large and receptive group. People became very enthusiastic about increasing 
    the possibilities of using ICT within their teaching. The fact the Whiteboard 
    worked all the time was also welcomed with technical hitches being the bane 
    of teaching using ICT effectively.</p>
    <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
  <p>Some cited lack of space and leads getting in the way as a disadvantage. 
    Setting up was a bit of a worry if staff had to do this on their own. The 
    fact that the class had to be moved was a concern and some staff would love 
    to have their own Whiteboard in their room as a permanent fixture (oh to live 
    in an ideal world!). Poor definition when used with the LCD tablet was a problem.</p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>All staff who used the Whiteboard were extremely enthusiastic about the possibilities 
    of the technology and a lot were inspired to use ICT more in their lessons 
    and were given confidence by the fact that the Whiteboard was reliable and 
    easy to use.</p>
  <p>Students were motivated and said that their learning had benefited from the 
    use of the Whiteboard. They liked the idea of being able to see what they 
    were supposed to be doing rather than being shown on their own computer. This 
    links in with accelerated learning techniques involving visual rather than 
    verbal instruction. The students said their attention was more focussed from 
    having a large focal point and colour image within the room. Above all the 
    staff and students really enjoyed the lessons.</p>
  <p>The only problems that people could foresee were the practicalities of ordering 
    the projector and leads being in the way of movement around the room. Initial 
    thoughts prompted the view that the lead problem could have a gender bias 
    but looking back at the questionnaires this did not seem to be the case, it 
    was more of a department bias. All the science staff cited leads being a problem; 
    this could be explained by their heightened awareness of safety in practical 
    situations with students moving around the room. This might be worth further 
    study or might not even enter into consideration if a dedicated room was used 
    with a ceiling mounted projector.</p>

    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
  <p>The ideal solution of a rear projected Whiteboard with a LCD projector is 
    the most costly option at ~&pound;6900. This negates the problem of leads 
    trailing across the teaching space, lack of room with it being taken up by 
    the projector and teachers standing in front of the Whiteboard.</p>
  <p>A very good solution for ICT teaching which provides a focus within the room, 
    a large image to use for demonstration and will show students what their work 
    should look like, is the use of an ordinary whiteboard with the computer screen 
    projected onto it. This would at the cheapest option cost ~&pound;3532 but 
    this all depends on the projection system used.</p>

    <h3><a name="CONCLUSIONS"></a>Whiteboard Conclusions</h3>
  <p>We looked at a wide variety of applications within the learning environment, 
    from Maths games and spreadsheets to using the Internet and Encarta. The Whiteboard 
    was very versatile and staff could see a lot of applications where it would 
    be an extremely useful tool.</p>
  <p>Not very much Teacher time was involved in preparation either for setting 
    up of the Whiteboard or preparation of resources. Staff were able to come 
    to the lesson and start a major advantage when using ICT in a classroom.</p>
  <p>Students were very motivated by the Whiteboard lessons and commented on the 
    fact that they had been able to understand much better what to do by being 
    shown rather than being told. Students remembered the lessons and hopefully 
    this will provide a prompt to the learning aim of the lesson. The large image 
    and a focal point in the room supported learning outcomes both in terms of 
    motivation and understanding.</p>
  <p>The interactive nature of the Whiteboard caused the most excitement for both 
    staff and students. Students were very enthusiastic and wanted to have a hands-on 
    role, this I think will have also supported any learning aims gained. There 
    is however the danger of &quot;Whiteboard fatigue&quot;, once the students 
    were accustomed to its presence would it still be a motivating factor? I was 
    unable to assess this aspect and it could possibly be worth looking at in 
    more detail. Would learning gains be affected by familiarity?</p>
  <p>The staff training aspect of the Whiteboards use was very welcome. Three 
    sessions were participated in by a significant number of staff. All people 
    involved said it greatly improved their understanding by being shown. Trainers 
    said it greatly aided them to deliver their courses to a large number. This 
    would have consequences for effective ICT training for staff in view of the 
    competencies required for all teachers by 2002.</p>
  <p>The LCD projector was the only effective option for clarity of the image 
    within our teaching spaces. The cost of this piece of vital equipment is the 
    prohibitive factor at approximately &pound;3640 and &pound;250 per bulb.</p>
  <p>The Whiteboard was used in three different computer dedicated rooms around 
    the school. Ideally a room needs to be dedicated to its use, a PC needs to 
    be also dedicated to its use and the projector which is vital to its function 
    needs to be ceiling mounted to negate worries about leads and space. This 
    ties up a lot of expensive resources within the school including technician 
    time. Is this the most cost-effective use of school resources?</p>
  <p>If we look in terms of a whole school focus, the technology needs to be seen 
    in the context of the New Opportunities Funding and staff ICT training. In 
    a large school this technology could be worth the expense to ensure all staff 
    reached, stayed at and progressed beyond baseline competencies in ICT by 2002.</p>
  <p>Overall it is a nice idea to have access to an excellent piece of technology 
    but at the same time in terms of learning gains another option could be to 
    use an ordinary whiteboard with a projector and a lot less costly.</p>
  <p>This initial study also gives rise to unanswered questions that could provide 
    the opportunity for further research:&nbsp;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Are learning gains affected by familiarity with the Whiteboard?</li>
    <li>Is motivation affected by familiarity with the Whiteboard?</li>
    <li>Learning outcomes for students could be looked at in much more detail.</li>
    <li>Are there any subject differences in how teachers use the Whiteboard?</li>
    <li>Are there subject or gender differences in the ways in which teachers 
      utilise the interactive nature of the board?</li>
    <li>Are some teachers more willing to allow students to get up and touch such 
      an expensive piece of equipment? And if this is the case why should this 
      be so?</li>
