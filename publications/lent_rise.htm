  <h2>How Lent Rise School coped with the snow</h2>
  <p><strong><img src="lentrise/pupil%20menu.jpg" alt="Lent Rise Snow Menu" title="Lent Rise Snow Menu" width="317" height="590" style="float:right; padding: 5px">Lent Rise County Combined School Buckinghamshire</strong> is a large and popular
    primary school servicing a socially diverse area. The school has 420 pupils
    on
      roll, with two classes per year. About a third of the pupils have special
    educational needs and, overall, pupils start with below average attainment.</p>
  <p>A key drive for the school is to put families at the heart of the learning
    process &#8211; to involve families more actively with the education of their
    children.</p>
  <p>Over the years, the school has developed an accessible learning platform,
    Lent Rise Learning World, to enable parents to share their child&#8217;s
    learning. The technology allows parents to share in the child&#8217;s class
    work. Real time reporting ensures that parents are kept up-to-date with their
    child&#8217;s progress and achievement at all times. Pupils also upload work
    to the learning platform to celebrate achievement. Parents now actively support
    learning at home and regularly check their child&#8217;s targets and progress,
    in fact this year parents are being encouraged to work with their child to
    agree one of the targets for the child each half term.&#8221;</p>
  <p>(By combining the non-technological (Parent Packs, the Parent Partnership
    Room, Family Fun Days, etc) and the technological (after-school cyber caf&eacute;,
    the learning platform, etc), the school is building a strong culture and
    expectation of family involvement and learning.)</p>
  <p>So what do we do when we have to close the school on &#8220;bad weather&#8221; days,
    not that that happens too often but with only 3 teachers living close enough
    to walk to school there are days when they really could not take responsibility
    for 420 children.</p>
  <p>The first thing we try to do is to make the decision the evening before
    as this helps parents to plan their childcare for the following day.</p>
  <p> We do this through a text / telephone cascade between staff who come from
      widely differing areas. If the decision is that the school must close we
      notify all staff and all parents through a texting system so that they
    have immediate notification of the closure and a reminder that an email will
    follow.
      The email then tells them what to look for as regards their child&#8217;s
      school work for the day.</p>
  <p> All staff immediately access the Learning platform and remotely input their
      classes work for the day into the class section on the Learning platform.
      Through that day they monitor this and where appropriate begin marking
      the work.</p>
  <p> Parents and children have access to the child&#8217;s portal and to the relevant
      sections of the platform and during the day will work remotely on work that
      has been set according to the needs of the child.</p>
  <p> So to sum up. Everyone knows that education is no longer something that
      has to be delivered only when you are within the four walls of your classroom.</p>
  <p> <strong><a href="lentrise/parent%20zone%20menu%20(Medium).jpg"><img src="lentrise/parent%20zone%20menu%20(Medium).jpg" alt="Lent Rise Snow Menu" width="160" height="112" style="float:right; padding: 5px" title="Lent Rise Snow Menu"></a></strong>Parents are very comfortable with using the platform as they do this regularly
      for the following reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Looking at their child&#8217;s portfolio of work</li>
    <li>Accessing their &#8220;reports&#8221; each half term</li>
    <li>Sharing their targets and now helping to define one target each half
    term</li>
    <li>Supporting their child to do at least one homework each week through
      the platform</li>
    <li>Taking on a family challenge on wet and windy days so that they show
        they have worked together on a subject they are interested in</li>
    <li>Seeking to expand their own horizons through accessing local courses
        and links to further education</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong><a href="lentrise/pupil%20menu.jpg"><img src="lentrise/pupil%20menu.jpg" alt="Lent Rise Snow Menu" width="160" height="112" style="float:right; padding: 5px" title="Lent Rise Snow Menu"></a></strong>Children love their remote access to a new world of learning. They do so
    much through this now that to access work on a snow closure day is almost
    second nature to them. They love the variety of the offering made to them
    through the platform:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Homework each week</li>
  <li>Family Learning projects where they can be the lead learner!!</li>
  <li>The head teachers Hotseat which seeks their opinion on a variety
    of things</li>
  <li>School Council and Healthy School Council chat rooms where they
    can debate their own needs for the future</li>
  <li>Never Ending stories which each
      child can contribute to thus creating a school story each term</li>
  <li>Quizzes</li>
  <li> Competitions</li>
</ul>
<p>So what the school has done is to create a rich and vibrant learning resource
    which makes learning accessible beyond the walls for children and parents
    and when the snow shuts the doors physically a new world is instantly accessible
    which allows learning to continue.</p>
<p> Parents love it! Some of the comments on Closure days show just how well
      our parents and children are using this resource.</p>
<p> Rebecca said &#8220;Alfie has been doing his homework every day after playing
    in the snow!&#8221;</p>
<p> Lois emailed to tell us, &#8220;I think the decision to close the snow was
      the right one and it was much appreciated that the closure was announced
      in good time, allowing us to make alternative arrangements. It&#8217;s
      really nice to already see teachers feedback on Lent Rise Learning World
      and we
      are making the best of it at home by also playing scrabble, chess and doing
    puzzle books etc (With the odd Harry Potter movie thrown in).&#8221;</p>
<p> Liz said &#8220;Totally understand and appreciate the emails and text messages
      keeping us up to date of the situation. Sophie has been doing the work
    set for 6A, albeit a bit reluctantly but it has been done!!&#8221;</p>
<p> Others merely responded, e.g. &#8220;Got texts and swathe school website.
    xxxxx is &#8220;happily&#8221; doing his work!!&#8221;</p>
<p> The nice thing was that the Headteacher also kept an eye on all that was
      going on and was able to respond immediately to need. E.g. a parent who
  had difficulty accessing the portal sent an email and this was sent on to the
      IT manager who immediately supported the parent by giving advice .and guidance
      on how to access the site and therefore the child&#8217;s work. The Headteacher
      responded to emails as they came in so that parents who had taken the time
    to express appreciation had an instant response.</p>
<p> There will always be the issue of the children who do not have access to
        the internet at home but there are always friends who live in the road
        who can be supportive and print off the work or a phone call to a neighbour
        will
        mean that the children can pass messages to each other. Everyone in this
      community has a phone so that keeps a supportive network alive and well.</p>
<p>Everyone is a winner but the biggest win of all is that all children with
    a little bit of thought and a network of friends can access learning now
    from wherever they are.</p>
