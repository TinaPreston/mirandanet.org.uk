  <h2>Vannevar Bush, Douglas Hartree, Jack Howlett</h2>
  <h3>And: did Watson of IBM really say that the world would only need five computers?</h3>
  <p>Some time ago your editor received an email from John Impagliazzo of Hofstra
    University, in which among other items he mentioned his <a href="http://www.comphist.org/">History
    of Computing</a>    web site. Your editor looked, and got a slight shock,
    as there is a family link with a machine on display on that web site. So
    I had a pleasant time
    reminiscing, and as nostalgia isn't what it used to be, here is an edited
    version of the reply I sent to John, which might be of interest to others.</p>
  <p>Dear John</p>
  <p>Your seemingly casual reference to your web site has opened up all sorts
    of thoughts and memories for me. As you know, you have a random image on
    your front page, and on the occasion that I happened to click I got the picture
    of <strong>Vannevar Bush</strong> and his <strong>differential analyser/analyze</strong>r.
    I have a remote connection with the UK development of this machine, which
    was a remarkable
    example of the early mechanical computers.</p>
  <p>Apparently the first UK differential analyser was built out of Meccano in
    1934 by <strong>Douglas Hartree</strong>. I am grateful to Meccano expert <a href="http://www.dalefield.com/">Wes
      Dalefield</a> who has found these references
    in facsimile pages of the Meccano Magazine:</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.nzmeccano.com/mm.php?p=Jun34pp4">Machine Solves Mathematical
      Problems: A Wonderful Meccano Mechanism</a> (June
    1934)<br>
    <a href="http://www.nzmeccano.com/mm.php?p=Jan51pp21">A Meccano Calculating
    Machine. Solving Complex Mathematical Equations</a> (January
    1951)<br>
    <a href="http://meccano.magazines.free.fr/html/1973/7310/73100054.htm">Among
    the Model Builders: Differential Analyser</a> (a follow-up article from
    1973)
  </p>
  <p>In addition, here is a further <a href="http://www.meccano.us/differential_analyzers/manchester_da/index.html">picture of
    the Hartree machine</a>, and here is a <a href="http://www.meccano.us/differential_analyzers/robinson_da/">modern
    reconstruction</a>    in Meccano.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/acl/literature/reports/p009.htm"><img src="howlett/diff_analyser_small.jpg" alt="Differential Analyser: Jack Howlett on the left at the front" width="200" height="159" class="imageRight" title="Differential Analyser: Jack Howlett on the left at the front"></a>This machine is on show at the Science Museum, London, next to half (yes,
    only half, and it takes up an enormous amount of space) of the full-scale
    version that Hartree had built. The other half is in the Museum of Science
    and Industry in Manchester.</p>
  <p>There's also an old black and white picture of the machine in action, with
      one operator in smart shirt and tie and dapper suit, quite recognisable
    to those who knew him, my father, <strong>Jack
      Howlett</strong>. </p>
  <p><a href="http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/acl/literature/reports/p009.htm">www.chilton-computing.org.uk/acl/literature/reports/p009.htm</a> </p>
  <p>I got quite a shock when I first saw this picture on public display in the
    Science Museum, as I had no idea of its existence. When I tackled my father,
    he replied in his usual modest way that yes, the Science Museum had asked
    him to talk about this machine, and it seems he was then probably the only
    person still alive in the UK at least who had any idea how the thing worked,
    as he had worked it extensively during the war (solving various rocketry
    problems and then some seminal work in the Tube Alloys project, which was
    the UK contribution to the Manhattan Project, as I later found out after
    his death). He then told me about Hartree building the Meccano version to
    see if it could be done, and of course it was pretty good and did the job
    at a fraction of the price of the full-size version. (Well, the model was
    more of a concept machine to see if it could be done. I have since read
    that the accuracy of the Meccano version was only about 2%.)</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10302771&amp;wwwflag=2&amp;imagepos=8">www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10302771&amp;wwwflag=2&amp;imagepos=8</a> </p>
  <p>    Apparently Hartree decided to build his analyser after hearing of Bush's
      contraption, but a nice symmetry is that the idea first came from Cambridge
      - one of Thomson's (Lord Kelvin's) inventions - where Hartree was working
      until he went to Manchester where one of his PhD students helped him in
      this task. When the war broke out, Hartree gathered a team of crack mathematicians,
      including my father who at the time was working as a railway mathematician,
      to work for him on a variety of projects, most of which were so hush hush
      I had no idea my father was involved in them until after his death. My
      father did his PhD with Hartree, and remained friends with him until Hartree's
      death. As a child I remember going to the Hartrees' house in Cambridge,
      where he had a 'pianola', and I loved to pretend that I could play a Chopin
      polonaise whilst pedalling furiously to keep this musical mechanical contraption
      going. I remember him as a really kind and nice man, always in a crumpled
      suit, and it was only much later that I realised that I had been playing
      in the house of one of the greatest theoretical physicists in the land.
      My parents remained in contact with his wife, my mother frequently visiting
      Elaine until her death, and I am the proud owner of a mahogany book shelf
      that once belonged to the Hartrees. A rather tenuous connection to one
      of the greats of the first half of the 20th century, I know, and one which
      very few people will appreciate, hence my care over telling you.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10302771&amp;wwwflag=2&amp;imagepos=8">www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Hartree.html</a> </p>
  <p>    Whilst looking for snippets, I came across a reference to Hartree in a mention
      of the famous Watson (head of IBM) quote about the world only needing about
      5 computers. It seems that there is no record of Watson ever saying this,
      but there is this quote on Hartree:</p>
  <p>&quot;I went to see Professor Douglas Hartree, who had built the first differential
    analyzers in England and had more experience in using these very specialized
    computers than anyone else. He told me that, in his opinion, all the calculations
    that would ever be needed in this country could be done on the three digital
    computers which were then being built -- one in Cambridge, one in Teddington,
    and one in Manchester. No one else, he said, would ever need machines of
    their own, or would be able to afford to buy them.&quot;</p>
  <p><img src="howlett/cpu_small.jpg" alt="Atlas CPU" title="Atlas CPU" width="200" height="163" class="imageRight">Well,
    back to my connection: my father was one of the post-war champions and pioneers
    of computers, running various computers for the government at
    Harwell (Mercury and Pegasus are names that I vaguely remember) and who eventually
    persuaded the UK government to pay for the Atlas Computer Lab at Culham,
    near Harwell, in what used to be Berkshire but is now in Oxfordshire. It
    was at the time the largest and most powerful in Europe if not the world,
    and he actually got the government to agree that University departments in
    the UK could use if for free for one day a week. This was true pioneering.</p>
  <p>I was often taken to view this machine, and it was enormous. [I've you've
    ever looked at the CPU in your home PC, bear in mind that it works faster
    and performs a greater variety of actions than the CPU you can see in this
    picture, complete with two of the several full-time staff it needed to keep
    it running! The picture below shows you how to change one of the many disc
    drive units - think of it more as a floppy!]</p>
  <p><img src="howlett/removable%20discs.jpg" alt="Atlas Removable Discs" title="Atlas Removable Discs" width="95" height="120" class="imageRight">&quot;Atlas lab had been set up, under the direction of Jack Howlett, a
    former student of Douglas Hartree, to run a powerful UK designed and manufactured
    machine, Atlas, for the benefit of UK science. To understand what was involved
    it has to be remembered, no doubt to the astonishment of some younger members
    of the audience, that there was a time when computers were hideously expensive,
    quite enormous engines. (As an aside, Atlas as installed in 1964, spread
    over two full floors of air-conditioned space, one floor devoted to holding
    the CPU and the other to holding the peripherals, largely Ampex one-inch
    tape drives and an enormous drum-store. It took 14 truck-loads to get the
    machine to the lab and it took three months to set-up and test. It cost &pound;2.5M
    at 1964 prices (so probably about &pound;50M at today's prices) and it developed
    .25 MIPS.&quot;</p>
  <p>There's a brief biography of my father here:</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/acl/associates/permanent/howlett.htm">www.chilton-computing.org.uk/acl/associates/permanent/howlett.htm</a> </p>
  <p>And details of the celebration of his life that the Atlas lab had after
    his death in 1999:</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/acl/associates/permanent/howlett/overview.htm">www.chilton-computing.org.uk/acl/associates/permanent/howlett/overview.htm</a> </p>

    might like to add Hartree to your hall of fame. From a UK perspective he
    ranks quite high, I think. I know there is no chance that you would
      add Jack Howlett to your hall of fame - trouble is, he was so modest that
      few people are aware of his role in promoting computers in the UK, so he
      wouldn't register. But, as you can tell, I'm immensely proud of him, and
      still somewhat in awe of him. He also taught me a lot about enjoying life,
    music, walking, and good wine!</p>
  <p>Thought you might be interested - if not, I've had fun writing this!</p>
