The aim of the evaluation was to gauge the views of teacher and pupil users of its Genee Vision Visualiser, and the ways in which it has impacted on their teaching, learning and work practice.<\/p>\n<p>This research collected data from the Genee Vision user base provided by Interactive Education to investigate the perceptions of teachers of the impact of the visualiser on learning, teaching and workflow.<\/p>\n<p>Data was collected through email contact, online questionnaires and personal interviews.<\/p>\n<h3>Terms of Reference<\/h3>\n<p>This report uses evidence collected from the data to determine the perceptions of teachers and students.<\/p>\n<p>Key benefits for both of these groups from the use of the Genee visualiser are analysed in terms of teaching, learning and work practice.<\/p>\n<p>Of particular interest are the ways in which teachers maximise the impact of the visualiser, whether through CPD, resources, ways in which they share any newly developed \u2018best practice\u2019, the impact of training versus non-training and work in different Key Stages.<\/p>\n<p>The evaluation includes a number of comments from teachers on the impact of the Genee Vision visualiser on teaching and how it has changed their lessons.<\/p>\n<h2>Executive summary<\/h2>\n<p>During July and September 2008 a number of schools across England were surveyed to investigate the ways in which they use the Genee Vision visualiser, and the ways in which it has impacted on their teaching, learning and work management.<\/p>\n<h3>Key Stage Coverage<\/h3>\n<p>All Key Stages were represented in participant schools: the majority, however, were in Key Stages 1 &amp; 2.<\/p>\n<h3>Curriculum subjects for which Genee Vision is used<\/h3>\n<p>Curriculum uses in the primary phase spanned the curriculum. In the Secondary phase the predominant use was for Science (64%) Other subjects in which Genee Vision was used were Maths, Design Technology and ICT (27%), Art and English (18%) and MFL and Citizenship (9% each).<\/p>\n<h3>Genee Vision effectiveness: Teacher ratings.<\/h3>\n<p>Teachers were asked to rate the effectiveness of the Genee Vision visualiser for a range of tasks:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For demonstrating processes,<\/li>\n<li>Showing detail to the whole class,<\/li>\n<li>Presenting pupil work,<\/li>\n<li>Integrating with other display technologies (IWB etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Bringing creativity into the class.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Responses were overwhelmingly positive.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>100%<\/strong> of teachers found it valuable or invaluable for showing detail to the whole class or demonstrating pupil work.<\/li>\n<li><strong>94%<\/strong> of respondents found it invaluable or valuable for demonstrating processes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>87%<\/strong> gave the same rating for integration with other display technologies such as interactive whiteboards.<\/li>\n<li><strong>84%<\/strong> of respondents reported it as invaluable or valuable for bringing creativity into the class.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Range of tasks for which visualisers are used<\/h3>\n<p>Teachers were asked to identify all the ways in which they used the Genee visualiser. In addition to projecting images to the whole class (97%), teachers identified a number of other uses to which the visualisers were put. Many teachers recorded images for future use (48%), for creating curriculum materials (42%) and for individual- and small-group pupil use (32%). Teachers also used them for distributing images for school use (19%), for pupil use (19%) and for creating animations (6%).<\/p>\n<p>Other uses cited were bringing the curriculum to life; direct microscopy (\u201ci.e., look down it!\u201d); analysing and editing pupils\u2019 work; assemblies; soldering demonstrations and showing a demo (although the respondent commented that it \u201cgets blurry\u201d); for practical demonstrations, and fault finding.<\/p>\n<h3>Ease of use<\/h3>\n<p>94% of Primary teachers and 71% of Secondary teachers said that it took less than half a day to become familiar with and use Genee Vision. Not only that, 24% of Primary and 82% of Secondary teachers were able to use it without any training. They found the program intuitive. However, the website user guide was of importance, as was support from the company. Indeed, 53% of primary teachers felt that the demonstration by Interactive Education was important.<\/p>\n<h3>Impact on teaching<\/h3>\n<p>100% of Primary teachers found the visualiser \u2018invaluable\u2019 or \u2018valuable\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>91% of Secondary teachers found the visualiser \u2018invaluable\u2019 or \u2018valuable\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Whole-class display was considered to be of most use by 58% of respondents; sharing pupil work by 26%. Other teachers found that the split-screen facility and the zoom facility were of use.<\/p>\n<h3>Impact on learning<\/h3>\n<p>One special school pupil commented that it was used in \u201c<em>lots of lessons &#8211; we like it<\/em>\u201d. He went on to say that \u201c<em>we would like one in our room all day<\/em>\u201d because \u201c<em>it shows us just what it is or what to do<\/em>\u201d. He commented that \u201c<em>you can see things clearly<\/em>\u201d and repeated \u201c<em>we would like one in our room all the time<\/em>\u201d.<\/p>\n<h3>Recommendations<\/h3>\n<p>Schools that use demonstrations and support from the company with all of the staff are more likely to find that the visualiser is used effectively than those where the responsibility for learning is devolved to individual teachers.<\/p>\n<h2>Evaluation Report<\/h2>\n<h2>Data analysis<\/h2>\n<p>Between June 16 and September 1 2008 some institutions identified as purchasers of the Genee Vision visualiser were invited to provide feedback on their uses of the equipment and software. Online questionnaires for teachers and their colleagues were hosted on the MirandaNet website. There were thirty-one respondents. 254 email addresses were provided by Interactive Education. 119 of these were returned as invalid or undeliverable.<\/p>\n<p>In real terms, therefore, the response rate, therefore, was 23%.<\/p>\n<h2>School profiles<\/h2>\n<h3>Key Stage(s) in which the Genee Vision visualiser is used.<\/h3>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"89\" valign=\"top\">\n<h3>KS1<\/h3>\n<\/td>\n<td width=\"89\" valign=\"top\">\n<h3>KS2<\/h3>\n<\/td>\n<td width=\"89\" valign=\"top\">\n<h3>KS3<\/h3>\n<\/td>\n<td width=\"89\" valign=\"top\">\n<h3>KS4<\/h3>\n<\/td>\n<td width=\"89\" valign=\"top\">\n<h3>Post-16<\/h3>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"89\" valign=\"top\">\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>14<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td width=\"89\" valign=\"top\">\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>19<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td width=\"89\" valign=\"top\">\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>11<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td width=\"89\" valign=\"top\">\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>13<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td width=\"89\" valign=\"top\">\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>9<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p><strong>(n = 31)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Reponses to the questionnaire were received from thirty-one schools.

Thirteen schools were Primary and covered both Key Stage One and Two: the visualiser was used in both these Stages. Five schools only used the visualiser in Key Stage Two. There were ten respondents from the secondary sector: nine used the visualiser at Key Stage Three, ten used it at Key Stage Four and six in the Post-16 phase.<\/p>\n<p>Three schools (one independent,

Teachers use them to support and enhance learning in the core subjects: English, Maths, Science, Design and Technology, History, Geography and Art, as well as RE.<\/p>\n<p>Like almost every other school that uses a visualiser the teachers have noted the impact of the whole-class display facilities on pupil understanding and learning. Teachers say that techniques can be clearly demonstrated \u2013 then saved, re-played and used later. This is particularly effective for art and handwriting. It is also a very useful way of showing a picture from a book to the whole class. The impact is even greater than when pupils have the book itself \u2013 or, as was previously the case, a scanned version of the picture.<\/p>\n<p>Philip Bowden, a class teacher at Radipole, comments that, in addition to the whole-class display facilities the visualiser has had a real impact on motivation.<\/p>\n<p>The visualisers have been very motivating for the children \u2013 they work very hard to be chosen to show their work under the visualiser at the end of a lesson.<\/p>\n<p align=\"right\">Phillip Bowden, Radipole Primary School.

IT Manager\/ICT Teacher<\/p>\n<p>Bordesley Village Children\u2019s Services have a significant number of Genee Vision visualisers, that are used in most subjects and classroom: in English, Maths, Science, Design and Technology, ICT, History, Geography, MFL, Art, Music, PE and RE. It\u2019s not only the whole-class display facilities that are valuable. The school also finds them extremely useful for self-assessment and assessment for learning. The visualisers <strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Add a new dimension, especially for giving instant feedback to pupils to help them with their self-assessment.<\/p>\n<p>commented Kenny Levack, a teacher at the school.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Using the visualisers for self-assessment.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We use the visualisers regularly, especially with our Writing lessons. As a habit now, our pupils assess their own work at the end of a lesson &#8211; simply by saying they are pleased with what they have done and have met their objectives &#8211; or that they are aware they could have done better. They also are given some short-term targets for literacy that were noticed in their last piece of independent written work. We remind them of their targets at the start and sometimes get the pupils themselves to &#8216;present&#8217; their work up on the visualiser and show that they have now started meeting their new target.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The visualiser can also act as a timely stimulus.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a reward \/ threat, we sometimes say we&#8217;ll be putting your work on the visualiser in 5 minutes&#8230;! (For some, it can have a great effect on output especially!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Collaborative work and evaluation is also supported by the use of visualisers.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For example, if the pupils have a target for their self assessment to remember to use capital letters and full stops, we will put their work up and then ask them what their target is and the good thing is that they can see instantly, along with the rest of the class how they are getting on with meeting that target.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on what interactive whiteboard board you use, you could even call upon the pupils to annotate or &#8216;correct&#8217; the work they can see up on the screen.<\/p>\n<p>This does work for all the pupils, they do all become more aware, (especially by seeing their own work and that of their peers regularly,) where their weaknesses lie &#8211; i.e. Punctuation missing &#8211; not enough adventurous vocabulary, capital letters missing, spelling mistakes etc!<\/p>\n<p>Fantastic!<\/p>\n<p align=\"right\">Kenny Levack, Bordesley Village Children\u2019s Services.

Headteacher<\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText2\">The ease of use of Genee Vision visualisers was commented on by a number of respondents.<\/p>\n<p><em>It gives opportunities that no other ICT provision can, enabling teachers to enhance their teaching very easily and effectively \u2026<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Opens up new opportunities for learning &#8211; comparable to when we first got a projector. It allows interactivity and encourages spontaneity &#8230;<\/p>\n<p>It is plugged into a projector or IWB to produce a large image on screen: essentially a document camera with some enhanced features. Resolution is good enough to make even the tiniest print on a leaflet readable at the back of a classroom.<\/p>\n<h2>Supporting sharing and spontaneity<\/h2>\n<p>King Edward VI Grammar School has six visualisers in use across the Science, ICT and Modern Foreign Languages departments. The spontaneous use of visualisers is particularly prized: they can be used to respond to a question, suggestion or material produced by a pupil, a group or the whole class. In a Science class, for example, a pupil can bring in a picture or an article and share it with the whole class: scientific specimens can be brought in and displayed. Pupils also use the visualiser for their own presentations to the class.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, materials can be displayed to the whole group for a number of purposes: exemplars of pupil work, the marking of sample work by the whole class, examination papers and answers on screen \u2013 the interactions between the work that is displayed, and the individuals in the class, produce a more objective response and supports learning.<\/p>\n<p>Ray Le Couteur, Head of ICT, feels that<\/p>\n<p>The essence is speed &#8211; you can switch between a pupil poster and a scientific sample in 10 seconds. So you can do things on the spur of the moment &#8211; e.g. quickly display a particularly good piece of work.<\/p>\n<p>Interactivity\/spontaneity is via what you do with the displayed material &#8211; the images themselves are passive (no difference between using just a projector and an IWB).<\/p>\n<p align=\"right\">Ray Le Couteur, King Edward VI Grammar School.

Some are non- verbal and non-numerate and yet with appropriate communication aids can demonstrate skills in matching, sorting, selecting and sequencing.  Frequently they show these skills using TEACCH materials, which allow them to move and organise photographs, pictures or symbols. Often, acquiring skills requires repetition. The Visualiser provides a unique opportunity to allow these students to demonstrate their skills with these materials publicly to each other. There is benefit from seeing others on a similar task (normally these are individual operations): accuracy of response increases as they watch each other perform. They also select and use scientific apparatus or assist in small-scale experiments that are then visible to the rest of the class (e.g. floating and sinking in a tank, constructing electric circuits).<\/p>\n<p>The Visualiser has further value in that we can capture images of familiar \u2018real\u2019 objects and insert them into other resources. Obviously, there is no rocket science here. However, using the Visualiser in this way seems to be a powerful reinforcement of learning and allows students to \u2018perform\u2019 in front of their peers \u2013 which is important to their social agenda, too.<\/p>\n<p align=\"right\">Peter Ryles, Beverley School for Autism.

IT Manager\/Instructor<\/p>\n<h2>Teaching Technology through Technology<\/h2>\n<p>Leyland St. Mary\u2019s CTC use two Genee Vision visualisers in teaching Design and Technology. They have found them particularly useful in the teaching of electronics, engineering and graphics, enabling all the pupils in the class to focus on processes and their products. The visualisers have had a great impact on peer assessment and assessment for learning.<\/p>\n<p>The visualisers have allowed processes to be demonstrated to whole classes. This has been of particular use in electronics, engineering and in graphics. The visualisers have also been of great value in sharing pupils\u2019 work with each other. This has been done effectively during whole school events, such as enterprise days etc. The visualisers are used to aid peer assessment where classes or year groups can comment on or view examples of individual or team work. This may be in the form of a product or design as well as written work.<\/p>\n<p>On the enterprise event, for example, pupils worked in teams and one of the tasks was for each team to create a team name and design a logo for their team. The pupils were in tutor groups, which were then split into smaller teams. The tutor groups evaluated the designs within their tutor group and voted the best through to the final. The year group was then brought together where all the finalist designs were shown to the entire year group via the visualiser. A similar method is used in lessons to facilitate AFL (Assessment For Learning) and in particular peer assessment.<\/p>\n<p align=\"right\">Travall Towriess, Leyland St Mary\u2019s CTC.

It uses them for English, Maths, Science, Design and Technology, History, Geography and Art, as well as RE. Philip Bowden, a class teacher at Radipole, comments that, in addition to the whole-class display facilities the visualiser has had a real impact on motivation.<\/p>\n<p>It has been very valuable in demonstrating techniques in art, handwriting and so on, as well as in looking at pictures in books \u2013 which would otherwise have to be scanned. The visualisers have been very motivating for the children \u2013 they work very hard to be chosen to show their work under the visualiser at the end of a lesson.<\/p>\n<p align=\"right\">Phillip Bowden, Radipole Primary School. Class teacher<\/p>\n<p>Many schools have noticed a real impact on the ways in which processes and techniques in Science and Design and Technology can be demonstrated \u2013 and captured to use in other contexts.<\/p>\n<p>It has modernised demonstrations and there is no longer a need for a huddle around the teacher\u2019s desk. Therefore pupils are not tempted to be off task.<\/p>\n<p align=\"right\">Stuart Wattley, Bristnall Hall Technology College. Director of Design and Technology<\/p>\n<p>Excellent use in sourcing close up work\/ product evaluation. Worksheets shared without photocopying. A Valuable resource, we can manage without it but it makes presentations and lessons easier and more exciting.<\/p>\n<p align=\"right\">David Dunlop, Rivington and Blackrod High School.

IT Manager\/ICT Teacher<\/p>\n<p>Bordesley Village Children\u2019s Services have a significant number of Genee Vision visualisers, that are used in most subjects and classroom: in English, Maths, Science, Design and Technology, ICT, History, Geography, MFL, Art, Music, PE and RE. They find them extremely useful for self-assessment and assessment for learning. Kenny Levack, a teacher at the school, commented that they<strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Add a new dimension, especially for giving instant feedback to pupils to help them with their self-assessment.<\/p>\n<p>We use the visualisers regularly, especially with our Writing lessons. As a habit now, our pupils assess their own work at the end of a lesson &#8211; simply by saying they are pleased with what they have done and have met their objectives &#8211; or that they are aware they could have done better. They also are given some short-term targets for literacy that were noticed in their last piece of independent written work. We remind them of their targets at the start and sometimes get the pupils themselves to &#8216;present&#8217; their work up on the visualiser and show that they have now started meeting their new target.<\/p>\n<p>The visualiser can also act as a timely stimulus.<\/p>\n<p>As a reward \/ threat, we sometimes say we&#8217;ll be putting your work on the visualiser in 5 minutes&#8230;! (For some, it can have a great effect on output especially!)<\/p>\n<p>Collaborative work and evaluation is also supported by the use of visualisers.<\/p>\n<p>If say for example the pupils have a target for their self assessment to remember to use capital letters and full stops, we will put their work up and then ask them what their target is and the good thing is that they can see instantly, along with the rest of the class how they are getting on with meeting that target.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on what interactive whiteboard board you use, you could even call upon the pupils to annotate or &#8216;correct&#8217; the work they can see up on the screen.<\/p>\n<p>This does work for all the pupils, they do all become more aware, (especially by seeing their own work and that of their peers regularly,) where their weaknesses lie &#8211; i.e. Punctuation missing &#8211; not enough adventurous vocabulary, capital letters missing, spelling mistakes etc&#8230;!<\/p>\n<p>Fantastic!<\/p>\n<p align=\"right\">Kenny Levack, Bordesley Village Children\u2019s Services. TLR manager Upper Key Stage 2<\/p>\n<p>The ability to link computer and whiteboard and switch between each easily is good&#8230; What would be even better would be to be able to use the glass mode of the Easiteach software so to be able to write on the display projected by the visualiser on the IWB<\/p>\n<p align=\"right\">Jason Hazrati, Heathlands at Townsend Asst. Headteacher<\/p>\n<p>The ease of use of Genee Vision visualisers was commented on by a number of respondents.<\/p>\n<p><em>It gives opportunities that no other ICT provision can, enabling teachers to enhance their teaching very easily and effectively.<\/em> (Anonymous)<\/p>\n<p>Opens up new opportunities for learning &#8211; comparable to when we first got a projector. It allows interactivity and encourages spontaneity.<\/p>\n<p>It is plugged into a projector or IWB to produce a large image on screen: essentially a document camera with some enhanced features. Resolution is good enough to make even the tiniest print on a leaflet readable at the back of a classroom.<\/p>\n<p>King Edward VI Grammar School has six visualisers in use across the Science, ICT and Modern Foreign Languages departments. The spontaneous use of visualisers is particularly prized: they can be used to respond to a question, suggestion or material produced by a pupil, a group or the whole class. In a Science class, for example, a pupil can bring in a picture or an article and share it with the whole class: scientific specimens can be brought in and displayed. Pupils also use the visualiser for their own presentations to the class.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, materials can be displayed to the whole group for a number of purposes: exemplars of pupil work, the marking of sample work by the whole class, examination papers and answers on screen \u2013 the interactions between the work that is displayed, and the individuals in the class, produce a more objective response and supports learning.<\/p>\n<p>Ray Le Couteur, Head of ICT, feels that<\/p>\n<p>The essence is speed &#8211; you can switch between a pupil poster and a scientific sample in 10 seconds. So you can do things on the spur of the moment &#8211; e.g. quickly display a particularly good piece of work.<\/p>\n<p>Interactivity\/spontaneity is via what you do with the displayed material &#8211; the images themselves are passive (no difference between using just a projector and an IWB).<\/p>\n<p>I intend to promote the visualiser on one of our training days and give examples of how they are used by me and get a few other enthusiasts to join in. I am sure we&#8217;ll gain a few new converts. Gradually the word will spread. (My two great enthusiasms at the moment are visualisers and mindmaps!)<\/p>\n<p align=\"right\">Ray Le Couteur, King Edward VI Grammar School. Head of ICT<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve used many types of visualizers and found that they are extremely beneficial for students with a wide range of skills (i.e. special needs and gifted). Multimodal learning and visualization are so important for every child. I particularly loved using the Proscope microscope with my students for science experiments.<\/p>\n<p align=\"right\">Mechelle<\/p>\n<p>Easy to adapt teaching and resources.

Lead Teacher ICT<\/p>\n<p>The William Read Primary School uses visualisers in every classroom, in KS1 and 2. Teachers use them for English, Maths, Science, Design and Technology, History, Geography, Art and RE.<\/p>\n<p>The visualiser has had a huge impact on teaching. It is a highly powerful teaching tool that provides the opportunity for immediate and effective feedback to pupils via peer and teacher evaluation of their work displayed on the visualiser. Texts can be shared and analysed more readily. The need for photocopying is greatly reduced and there is no longer a need to scan items ready for sharing. The zoom and freeze facilities are enormously valuable in areas such as Science e.g. the parts of a flower, seed dispersal. The split screen and mirror functions are also highly valuable in areas such as Maths and Art and Design.<\/p>\n<p>Pupils easily and quickly learn the different functions and use them for pupil led presentations.
