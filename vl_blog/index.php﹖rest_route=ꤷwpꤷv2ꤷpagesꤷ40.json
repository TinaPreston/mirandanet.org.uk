Pioneered by J.Novak and developed by many researchers like McAleese, Ahlberg and Jonnassen, concept mapping is a more cognitively demanding form of diagrammatic representation.<br \/>\nThe development of graphic representations Representations are what cognitive processes act on in creativity, learning and understanding to construct meanings of the world. They have internal and external expression.<br \/>\n\u2022 External representations of knowledge involve both symbolic, as in linguistic forms, and analogical representations, as in graphic or pictorial forms.<br \/>\n\u2022 Internal representations are able to represent only some aspects of the environment and parallel external representations by differences between propositional and analogical representations.<br \/>\n&#8211; Propositional representations capture ideational content of mind and are language-like.<br \/>\n&#8211; &#8211; Analogical representations tend to be perceptual images: visual, auditory or kinaesthetic.<br \/>\n&#8211; How can we access external and internal representations that indicate quality of learning?<br \/>\n&#8211; \u2022 A method for supporting ideation and the generation of connections between thoughts or accepted concepts is the use of diagrammatic forms of representation about the world.<br \/>\n&#8211; \u2022 These diagrammatic representations have different levels of complexity which develop from spidergrams into concept mapping.<br \/>\n&#8211; \u2022 Concept mapping is more advanced and includes relational links, to keep the mapping refined and of a higher order of representation.<br \/>\n&#8211; \u2022 A way of strengthening links is to include vectors. This enhances the connections visually, impacting on the relational interpretation between the concepts, making the relationship more meaningful in terms of actional and transactional structure.<br \/>\n&#8211; \u2022 The combination of both graphic and linguistic notation in concept mapping may more closely define the idea or concept being represented and reduces the possible number of interpretations.<br \/>\nIs there a valid place in practice for another form of expression to compete with literacy, art and drama? The development of ICT-based concept mapping software has meant that mapping can be designed using digital objects available in multimedia. This has meant an evolution of the term concept mapping to multimodal mapping to encompass representation in auditory, graphic, image, videographic, cinematic and text modalities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Useful communities<\/strong><br \/>\nUseful communities include:<br \/>\nInstitute for Human and Machine Cognition &#8211; Organisation started by Joseph Novak that inaugurated the World Congress into Concept Mapping.

The link labels can often become labels for concepts.<br \/>\nIf these possible concepts become important while constructing and improving a concept map, you may draw a frame round them and use them as \u2018real\u2019 concepts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Activity<\/strong><br \/>\nFor practice and modelling try mapping a well known story such as \u2018Matilda\u2019 by Roald Dahl or a favourite of yours.<br \/>\nMap only the main elements from which all the and action are introduced.<br \/>\nNow try mapping the middle on a new map.<br \/>\nTry reading it back to yourself.<br \/>\nDoes it include the basic plot \u2018kernel\u2019?<br \/>\nNow map the ending. Do all three maps cover the basic plot structure of the story? Have you labelled all the links?<br \/>\nCan your maps be converted into speech and \/ or writing? Do other people agree with your ideas? Does your map accurately represent the plot \u2018kernel\u2019 ? Sometimes it is good to be able to read concept maps in the order that you intend it to be read therefore links may be numbered.<br \/>\nThese are some good self-study resources:<br \/>\nCaviglioli, O. &amp; Harris, I.
