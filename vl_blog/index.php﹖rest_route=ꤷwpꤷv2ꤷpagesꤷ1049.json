It\u2019s an application that will create a visual representation of a piece of text, based on word frequency. The more often a particular word occurs, the larger it will appear.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">This sort of application has two immediately obvious applications. Firstly, it can be used to very quickly get across the gist of a piece of text. I used this in <a href=\"http:\/\/terry-freedman.org.uk\/db\/compic\/doc_page2.html\">my summary<\/a> of the ICT Level Descriptors in order to be able to convey very quickly what was expected from students at each Level. You can see from the illustration below that this is a very appealing approach, especially if you\u2019re a visual learner. It gives you an immediate way in to the data. It\u2019s not a substitute for a more in-depth study of it, but it\u2019s a good way of helping you to organise your thoughts before you do so.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\" src=\"http:\/\/img.ymlp.com\/tsfq_geotaggingwordle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"295\" \/><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Another kind of use for word clouds is to check if what you\u2019ve written about reflects what you intended to write about. It\u2019s all too easy to get sidetracked into a different train of thought entirely. Students are good at doing this when they\u2019re writing essays. Throwing the text into a word cloud generator is a quick and easy way to see if that has happened and, if it has, demonstrating it to the student.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">There is a third use for word clouds, which is to help you tag an article before publishing it to the internet. Presumably you already know what you\u2019ve written about, but the word cloud may yield a couple of sub-themes which you hadn\u2019t consciously been aware of.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">For example, in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ictineducation.org\/home-page\/2010\/4\/14\/web-20-for-rookies-geotagging.html\">my article on geotagging<\/a>, I included a few references to photos and video. Now I had clearly meant to, but the interesting this is that until I generated the word cloud it didn\u2019t occur to me that tagging the article with the terms \u2018photography\u2019, \u2018digital photography\u2019 and \u2018video\u2019 would be quite appropriate.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Yet another use is to illustrate the article from which the word cloud was generated. This is a little self-referential perhaps, but sometimes it is difficult to find a suitable photo or drawing with which to embellish a piece of text. In such circumstances, a word cloud does the job very nicely.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Finally, another use, which I will be expanding on below, is to enable you to explore the data in more detail. For example, you will be able to find out how many times a particular word occurs, which may prove useful to anyone hoping to improve their use of English \u2013 or who helps others to do so.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Until recently, my word cloud generator of choice was Wordle, which is what I used for the screenshot above. However, a few weeks ago I received an email from Hardy K.S. Leung from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tagxedo.com\/\">Tagxedo<\/a>, telling me about the new service and inviting me to try it out. Here\u2019s how he described the features:<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Highly interactive (no server round-trip)<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Fast cloud generation time<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">No registration required<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Custom shapes<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Use image as shapes<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Words as shapes<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Powerful layout engine (very nice shape hugging)<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Lots of fonts<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Accepting user-uploaded fonts<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Save to image files (Png or Jpeg)<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">History view (see all &#8220;versions&#8221; and pick the one you like)<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Now, there is obviously a lot there to recommend it. Wordle, the one I normally use, is quite basic by comparison. So, I thought I\u2019d do a comparative review, bringing in two other such services too: TagCrowd and Many Eyes. Here are the results, based on my article about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ictineducation.org\/home-page\/2010\/4\/13\/11-essential-elements-of-a-digital-financial-literacy-course.html\">digital financial literacy<\/a>.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Wordle<\/span><\/h2>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/wordle.net\/\">http:\/\/wordle.net<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">This is Wordle\u2019s interpretation of the article on financial literacy. I generated this by copying and pasting the text. I mention this because when I used the URL of the article instead, Wordle worked on my most recent blog entry, not the URL submitted. Tagxedo, on the other hand, interpreted the URL correctly.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\" src=\"http:\/\/img.ymlp.com\/tsfq_financialliteracywordle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"295\" \/><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Tagxedo<\/span><\/h2>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tagxedo.com\/\">http:\/\/www.tagxedo.com\/<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Here is Tagxedo\u2019s treatment of the same article.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\" src=\"http:\/\/img.ymlp.com\/tsfq_financialliteracytagxedo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"295\" \/><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">I would say that although Tagxedo may have the edge over Wordle in terms of how far you can customise the results, it has not done a good job of reflecting the gist of the article. When you look at the Wordle word cloud, you can see straight away that the article was about financial literacy. That cannot be said for the Tagxedo word cloud.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Therefore, I\u2019d suggest that Tagxedo would be a good tool to use if you\u2019re looking for a way to jazz up a piece of writing, or the cover of a coursework assignment. I would not recommend it as a means of summarising what a piece of writing is about. Yet: Tagxedo is currently in beta, so I think it would be worth revisiting the site every couple of weeks to see if the algorithm it uses has improved.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">TagCrowd<\/span><\/h2>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/tagcrowd.com\/\">http:\/\/tagcrowd.com\/<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Here is the word cloud generated by TagCrowd.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\" src=\"http:\/\/img.ymlp.com\/tsfq_financialliteracytagcrowd.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"115\" \/><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">I think you\u2019d agree that it\u2019s rather minimalist. However, it does have some attractive features behind the scenes. For example, you can set the maximum number of words to show, and their minimum frequency. You can also tell it to ignore the words in a customised list. All this makes it a more serious and, I think, a more serious tool than Wordle.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Many Eyes<\/span><\/h2>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com\/manyeyes\/\">http:\/\/manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com\/manyeyes\/<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Here\u2019s the word cloud that Many Eyes generated:<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\" src=\"http:\/\/img.ymlp.com\/tsfq_financialliteracymanyeyes.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"150\" \/><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">This is not as good, in my opinion, as the Wordle word cloud \u2013 but bear with me. Many Eyes has a number of things up its sleeve, including what they call an <strong>enhanced tag cloud generato<\/strong>r. Here is the result I obtain when I use that instead, and then put the mouse pointer over the word \u2018financial\u2019:<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\" src=\"http:\/\/img.ymlp.com\/tsfq_financialliteracymanyeyesenhanced.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"202\" \/><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">As you can see, rather than merely returning the number of times the word occurs, it gives the <strong>context<\/strong> in which these instances occur. This makes the tag cloud a much more revealing, and therefore useful, tool.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">I mentioned other features of Many Eyes. These may be summarised as follows:<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Be sociable<\/span><\/h2>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">First of all, Many Eyes facilitates collaboration or, at the very least, being able to use other people\u2019s data. This is because in order to use any of the data handling features you have to register, and then if you want to use your own data you have to upload it. This then makes it available for everyone else to use. The result is that there are lots of data sets to choose from for your data-handling work: no more looking for ingenious ways of generating new large data sets.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">There is a 90 day restriction on using the data sets, so I\u2019d suggest contacting the owner of any data you wanted to use in order to obtain permission to keep it for longer if necessary.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Not just word clouds\u2026<\/span><\/h2>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">I\u2019ve already mentioned that there is an \u2018enhanced\u2019 version of the word cloud. There are several other ways to explore blocks of text, and these are potentially very powerful indeed.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<h3><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Word tree<\/span><\/h3>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">In this, you enter a word or phrase, and then the tool creates a sort of mind map in which you can see which phrases lead on from, or lead to, the word or phrase you\u2019ve entered. For example, look at how the text is treated using the phrase \u2018financial literacy\u2019:<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\" src=\"http:\/\/img.ymlp.com\/tsfq_wordtree.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"202\" \/><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Now, it\u2019s a bit hard to see the detail in this screenshot, but I think you can get the general idea. What\u2019s happened is that we\u2019ve been provided with a list of phrases and the phrases that emanate from them. Moreover, this data is dynamic. For example, you can make any of the words in a branch the source of a new branch. Also, deciding on the word or phrase to use is quite a skill in itself, and lends itself to discussion work followed by trial and error and further discussion.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<h3><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Phrase net<\/span><\/h3>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">This analyses the block of text in terms of the relationships between words, using connectors like \u2018and\u2019 and wildcards. For example, in this phrase net generated from the England and Wales ICT Programme of Study, the word \u2018organise\u2019 is connected to several other words.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\" src=\"http:\/\/img.ymlp.com\/tsfq_phrasenet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"476\" height=\"294\" \/><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">This immediately suggests, I think, what the architects of this curriculum had in mind, and what kind of things should be considered under the heading \u2018organisation\u2019. Furthermore, holding the mouse pointer over a connecting line will, again, reveal the number of times the words are connected and the sentence in which those connections occur.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">\u2026 And not just words<\/span><\/h2>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Unlike Wordle and the others, which cannot handle tabulated data especially well, Many Eyes can. You simply copy\/paste the data from a spreadsheet, and then you can start working with it.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Again, you have several options available to you, including bar charts, tree maps, bubble charts and even a world map. I would certainly recommend that you introduce your data-handling colleagues \u2013 history, mathematics, geography and science immediately spring to mind \u2013 and invite them to play around with it and perhaps come up with ways of using Many Eyes\u2019 charting facilities with their students.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">So what?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">All this could, of course, be a sledgehammer to crack a peanut if all you want to do is generate a pretty picture or get a quick idea of what a piece of text is all about. However, I think these tools are potentially much more useful than that.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">I mentioned in passing that I had used the text of the ICT Programme of Study in the Phrase Net tool. I also used it in the Word Tree tool, using the word \u2018information\u2019 as a filter. Here\u2019s what I got:<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\" src=\"http:\/\/img.ymlp.com\/tsfq_informationtree.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"200\" \/><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">As before, it\u2019s not easy to see the detail, but what this has done is create a complete list of how the word \u2018information\u2019 is used in the entire Programme of Study. Moreover, because I used the default setting of arranging the phrases in the order in which they occur, I can see at a glance how the concept of information is used in each Level Descriptor, and how it is refined as we move up the Levels.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Thus at Level 1, children are expected to know that information can come in various forms. At the higher levels, however, they must use this knowledge to tailor their work for different specific audiences.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Conclusions<\/span><\/h2>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times;\">Clearly there is a lot more to word clouds than the usual Wordle-type representation that many of us are familiar with. It\u2019s difficult to recommend one particular application because each has its strengths and weaknesses.
