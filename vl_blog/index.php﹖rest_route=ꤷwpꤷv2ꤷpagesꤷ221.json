Nowadays, computers have made it easier to analyse large quantities of data and present the results graphically with minimal time and effort. But conversely, data handling software can limit the modes of presentation and, used intelligently, provides the means to obscure the facts. Edward Tufte is a celebrated historian who has looked at graphical presentation of data throughout the ages. He presents this point well.<\/p>\n<p>Enthusiasts, partisans, and liars have long tinkered with graphical evidence by de-quantifying images, selecting and hyping advantageous visual effects, distorting data. Recently, inexpensive computing and ingenious techniques for image processing have provided endless new opportunities for mischief. Arbitrary, transient, one-sided, fractured, undocumented materials have become the great predicament of image making and processing. How are we to assess the integrity of visual evidence?<\/p>\n<p>This quotation comes from Edward R. Tufte, Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative. 1997. He has produced a series that is cited in the resources section. These books present an attractive and exciting perspective on the communication of synthesised information.<\/p>\n<p>This community seems to have an answer to the question.
