It is described as a free teaching tool that allows students to learn fundamental programming concepts in the context of creating animated movies and simple video games. In A.L.I.C.E. 3-D objects (e.g., people, animals, and vehicles) populate a virtual world and students create a program to animate the objects. A.L.I.C.E. is free open source software: the A.L.I.C.E. project is based at Carnegie Mellon University.<\/p>\n<p>In this excerpt pupils describe how they use the program to create their own games and virtual worlds as part of their ICT programme of study. This, and the use of Open Sim, reinforce learning through Learner involvement, Creativity and Personalisation.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blip.tv\/file\/1588953\/\">Creating a virtual world (1)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The video file is embedded in the player above.
