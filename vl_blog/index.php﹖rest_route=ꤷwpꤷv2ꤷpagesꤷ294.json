A research team from Keele University has worked with 12 partner school mathematics departments to evaluate the use and effectiveness of teaching when the technology is used to advantage. Evidence suggests that the presentational advantages of interactive whiteboard use are considerable and that the consequent motivational gain is to be welcomed. However, it is also clear that neither of these add to teaching effectiveness unless they are supported by teachers who understand the nature of interactivity as a teaching and learning process and who integrate the technology to ensure lessons that are both cohesive and conceptually stimulating.<\/p>\n<p>Averis, D., Glover, D., Miller, D.

The impact of interactive whiteboards.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>During the past two years Interactive Whiteboards have been installed in an increasing number of classrooms in the United Kingdom. Most teachers have embraced the technology: they see it as something that supports and extends their teaching capability (Smith, 1999; Levy, 2002). The affordances of interactive whiteboard technology, however, do more than reinforce traditional classroom praxis: they provide ways to make learning an interactive process; they create possibilities for teachers to transform their role (Glover &amp; Miller, 2001). As yet, however, research evidence on the impact of IWBs on pedagogy is limited.<\/p>\n<p>Changes that have taken place in teaching and learning have previously been assessed (Cuthell, 2002). This paper describes seven action research projects across England, sponsored by MirandaNet and Promethean, that assessed the effect of Promethean ACTIVboards on student learning, the impact on pedagogical skills, and relates the evidence to a year-long national survey of school implementation of IWB technology and teacher attitudes.<\/p>\n<p>Data was collected during 2003 from teacher surveys, case studies and observation of classroom practice.<\/p>\n<p>Cuthell, J.

Greiffenhagen (2000) has shown that the use of the technology as an adjunct rather than as an integrated element in teaching minimises interaction and matching of teaching to learning needs. McCormick and Scrimshaw (2001) have developed this in their analysis of the contribution of ICT to pedagogic change in teaching mathematics and their contention that teaching can only be enhanced if interactivity is understood. The reality of interactivity as supported by information and communications technology in general has been explored by John and Sutherland (2005) who point to the need for teacher understanding of the relationship between subject area, the learning domain and the technology if there is to be pedagogic change, and demonstrated by Armstrong et al (2005) in their investigation of the changes inherent in teacher and learner use of IAWs as a new affordance within the classroom. Miller et al (2004) have followed similar lines of investigation to establish the developmental phases as teachers recognise the necessary pedagogic changes for effective technology use as the basis of enhanced learning.<\/p>\n<p>Glover, D., Miller, D., Averis, D. and Door, V.

Twelve group interviews (72 students) were conducted between January and Easter 2004 with Year 6 students (between 10 and 11 years of age) in six Local Education Authority (LEA) areas located in the North and South of England. Students were very enthusiastic about particular aspects of IWBs, such as their versatility in the classroom, multimedia capabilities and the fun and enjoyment they brought to learning. Students also highlighted, however, technical problems, teacher and students&#8217; information and communication technology skills and students&#8217; lack of access to the technology as negative aspects.<\/p>\n<p>Hall, I.

In this project interactive whiteboards (IWBs) were installed in Year 5 and Year 6 classes in 12-15 schools in each of six Local Education Authorities (LEAs): Cumbria, Bracknell Forest, Lewisham, Oxfordshire, Redcar and Cleveland, and Wakefield. In each of these LEAs a local co-ordinator was appointed as an IWB Consultant to manage the project locally and to provide training and support to the teachers involved. The pilot project ran from Autumn 2002 to Summer 2004.<\/p>\n<p>The evaluation, undertaken by a team based in the Centre for Learning and Teaching in the School of Education Communication and Language Sciences at Newcastle University investigated aspects of classroom interaction through a series of structured observations, the views of teachers and pupils through interviews, teachers\u2019 weekly records of IWB use and the impact on pupils\u2019 attainment through their performance in national Key Stage 2 tests. In addition a literature review was undertaken to support both the pilot project and the evaluation.<\/p>\n<p>Higgins, S., Clark. J., Falzon.

Through this detailed scrutiny the following questions emerge:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>How do the new technologies reshape knowledge as curriculum?<\/li>\n<li>How does the use of new technologies in the classroom reshape learning pedagogy?<\/li>\n<li>As writing moves from page to screen, what is the impact on students&#8217; situated literacy practices and learning? Through these questions, this book demonstrates that modes of representation, technology and curriculum knowledge are fundamentally connected, and describes how teacher and students roles in the classroom could be altered in the face of new technologies.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Jewitt, C (2006) Technology, literacy and learning: a multimodal approach, London: RoutledgeFalmer. <a href=\"http:\/\/ioewebserver.ioe.ac.uk\/ioe\/cms\/get.asp?cid=16841&amp;16841_0=16846\">http:\/\/ioewebserver.ioe.ac.uk\/ioe\/cms\/get.asp?cid=16841&amp;16841_0=16846<\/a><\/p>\n<p>A Review Of The Research Literature On Barriers To The Uptake Of ICT By Teachers.<\/p>\n<p>This report brings together evidence from a range of sources on the actual and perceived barriers to the uptake of ICT by teachers, as identified in a review of some of the available literature associated with teachers\u2019 use of ICT, and also by education practitioners who took part in a small scale survey, carried out by Becta.
