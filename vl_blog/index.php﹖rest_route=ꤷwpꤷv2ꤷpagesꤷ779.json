It is described as a free teaching tool that allows students to learn fundamental programming concepts in the context of creating animated movies and simple video games. In A.L.I.C.E. 3-D objects (e.g., people, animals, and vehicles) populate a virtual world and students create a program to animate the objects. A.L.I.C.E. is free open source software: the A.L.I.C.E. project is based at Carnegie Mellon University.<\/p>\n<p>At a MirandaMod held at the WLE Centre, Institute of Education, University of London, Dai Barnes explains how &#8211; and why &#8211; he uses Alice to teach his classes how to create virtual worlds.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dai Barnes<\/strong> is Head of Academic and In-Curriculum ICT at St Benedict&#8217;s School, Ealing. He qualified as a teacher in 1995 and spent eighteen months as a supply teacher in  a broad range of London schools. Hestarted work as a full-time ICT teacher at a secondary school where he was quickly promoted to Head of Department.
