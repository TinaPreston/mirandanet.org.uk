The teacher modelled letter formation on the interactive whiteboard, which was also used to display software programs and multimedia phonic children&#8217;s worksheets. Observation indicates that the uses of an interactive whiteboard only resulted in a slight improvement in the pupils&#8217; letter formation, but did have a positive effect on the motivation and enjoyment of both the teacher and the pupils.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Methodology<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The nursery nurse made written observations and took photographs of the children being taught phonics using an interactive whiteboard.

Date: 2005<\/p>\n<p>The teacher investigated the impact of using an interactive whiteboard as the main teaching tool to introduce the concept of measure to reception children. The children used images of monkeys to measure other animals on the interactive whiteboard. The study focused on low attaining children within her class. Observations, questioning and written notes formed the basis of the evaluation.<\/p>\n<p>The children on whom the study focused responded very positively to the interactive whiteboard. All of the children were engaged in watching others demonstrate measuring on the whiteboard, and several were motivated to do the measuring themselves. The children were confident in applying their conceptual learning to their practical work, and questioning revealed that even those who were reluctant to participate had a clear understanding of the theory. The teacher concluded that the interactive whiteboard had had a profound effect on engagement and motivation, but noted that its effectiveness depended on the training and confidence of the teacher.<\/p>\n<p>View the full case study: <a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/5d4set\">http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/5d4set<\/a><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Using interactive teaching equipment in assemblies<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Author: Jackie Barbet, Deputy Head teacher, Furze Infants&#8217; School, Barking and Dagenham. Date: 2005<\/p>\n<p>Jackie introduced the visualiser into assemblies, and interviewed children to gauge their perceptions. She found that the use of the visualiser improved behaviour and engagement. This was largely due to the increased audio and visual clarity in presentation that the technology offered, particularly for students bringing objects for &#8216;show and tell&#8217; and for amplifying the voices of students addressing the audience. The style of the visual presentation engaged students effectively, perhaps because &#8220;children are used to a very high level of sophistication in their entertainment these days&#8221; and presentations on the visualiser come closer to meeting their high standards.<\/p>\n<p>View the full case study: <a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/5of89w\">http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/5of89w<\/a><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Evaluating the contribution which a digital camera and interactive whiteboard can make to improve speaking and listening in the nursery<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Author: Elizabeth Hayton, Willington Primary School, County Durham.

To try and stimulate speaking and listening in the class and at home, the teacher sent home a teddy and a digital camera with two students each weekend, to take pictures to show the class on Monday. The interactive whiteboard was then used to display the images while the child spoke.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The teacher perceived some improvement in overall speaking and listening in the class. In reporting back to the class, the visual hook of the photographs supported students&#8217; speech, while the rest of the class listened and asked questions.

Date: 2005<\/p>\n<p>Since joining an ICT Test Bed school, Emma has converted from being a sceptic to an ICT enthusiast. Here, she gives specific examples of her use of ICT across a range of subjects, and reflects on the value of technology, including enhanced demonstration capability and the generation of learner engagement and motivation.<\/p>\n<p>Her reflections suggest that the greater interactivity afforded by technology is key to learner engagement and achievement. The reciprocity rule suggests that you get out what you put in: by providing more opportunities for learners to participate practically in learning exercises, technology can correspondingly enable the students to get more out of the classroom experience.<\/p>\n<p>Emma does not consider the impact of her use of technology on standards. She does, however, list her top websites and offer procurement advice, arguing that, given the choice, she would rather have a Promethean whiteboard with the Active Primary Suite (visualiser) than a smart board.<\/p>\n<p>View the full case study: <a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/59wf4s\">http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/59wf4s<\/a><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Researching whether the use of ICT in reception motivates and promotes children&#8217;s learning in numeracy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Author: Caroline Percival, Teaching Assistant, Hartside Primary School, Durham. Date: 2005<\/p>\n<p>Caroline investigated the pupils&#8217; perceptions of using ICT in numeracy. She compared the teaching of three different topics, taught once with the use of ICT, and once without. She evaluated the children&#8217;s views on the use of ICT by means of a simple questionnaire that included a range of suggested answers from which they could choose. The children&#8217;s preferences for ICT or non-ICT equipment varied between different activities, and were randomly spread across different ability levels and genders. It was difficult to draw any conclusions about the children&#8217;s preferences from the data collected. Caroline also asked two teachers about their perceptions of the children&#8217;s learning with ICT, both of whom believed that it was a major motivating factor.<\/p>\n<p>View the full case study: <a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/5r5k4x\">http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/5r5k4x<\/a><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>An evaluation of the impact of ICT on boys&#8217; attitudes to literacy in early foundation stage.

Date: 2005<\/p>\n<p>The teacher conducted observations of four boys participating in a variety of writing activities, some of which involved the use of a range of ICT (such as software, laptops and PCs). The observations showed that the boys had a very positive attitude to learning literacy through ICT. Interviews with the focus group revealed that they liked spelling their names using the ICT equipment. The teacher felt that her pupils used the ICT as a means to scaffold their learning, in order to work at a higher level than they would otherwise have achieved.<\/p>\n<p>View the full case study: <a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/6g5dot\">http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/6g5dot<\/a><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The changing role of the teacher in using the Interactive White Board (IWB)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Author: Victoria Eaton, Class Teacher, Sunnybrow Primary School, Durham. Date: 2005<\/p>\n<p>The teacher reflects on how her role has changed since using the IWB with her Year 3 and 4 children. She felt that originally, despite the children coming up to the IWB to click, drop and drag, lessons were still very much teacher-directed. During one numeracy lesson the teacher decided to sit to the side of the class, allowing the children to the front to direct the lesson. The children rose to the challenge, and with careful questioning explained their reasoning. They began to question and collaborate with each other to solve the maths problems, rather than automatically looking to the teacher. In Victoria&#8217;s words, the learning became &#8220;personalised, appropriate and relevant.&#8221; She feels that the IWB excites children, such that they want to become active participants in their learning. Informal interviews with the children reveal that they feel the IWB makes them think for themselves, and though they feel that they are working harder, they still enjoy it far more than lessons without the IWB. The teacher has noticed that children with special educational needs are also more motivated to interact and have a turn.<\/p>\n<p>View the full case study: <a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/6jy83o\">http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/6jy83o<\/a><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Evaluating the contribution of Activote within the classroom<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Author: Martin Holt, Hunwick Primary School.

Date: 2006<\/p>\n<p><strong>Summary<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Elizabeth reflects on the use of ICT with two children in particular, one who has autism and one with less severe special needs. She describes how the use of ICT stimulated both children and encouraged them to become more involved in class activities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Action<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>PCs, an Interactive Whiteboard and a digital camera were among the tools used to help the children become more involved in the classroom, although the teachers were careful not to use these to the exclusion of more traditional hands-on methods, such as painting or playing with sand and water.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Both children enjoyed using the ICT tools and became much more involved in classroom activities, interacting far more than before with other children in the class. The child with more severe difficulties however started to spend too much time using the equipment, and was reluctant to become involved in other activities.

Date: 2005<\/p>\n<p>The teacher investigated how the use of Digital Blue microscopes would develop learning in science. The pupils used the microscopes connected to laptops,or an interactive whiteboard, to examine the structures and opacity of a range of materials. The teacher felt that the microscopes would particularly appeal to visual and kinaesthetic learners.<\/p>\n<p>Using the microscopes has enabled the children to take a more active, participatory role in their learning, and to gain greater ownership of their learning experiences. The teacher observed that the children enjoy science lessons more when using the microscopes. In particular, they liked sharing their findings with the rest of the class, a process which the technology facilitated. The amount of detail provided by the microscopes enabled the pupils to draws conclusions of a much higher quality than usual and their technical vocabulary and general communication skills have improved significantly.
