The journal serves as the official journal of the International Graphic Arts Education Association, and provides a professional communicative link for educators and industry personnel associated with design, presentation, management, and reproduction of graphic forms of communication. However, many educators publish in this journal.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget simple, free but powerful tools such as PhotoStory3 from Microsoft. It turns stills into video by using rostrum panning and allows the addition of graphic effects as well as narrative.<\/p>\n<p>I have just used it in a G+T project where groups of pupils (mixed ages from Y5 to Y8) had to use this very simple tool to create a presentation that would persuade the management of Intergalactic travel Inc. to make their biome the preferred stop on Earth.

Building on strategies from online role-playing games, QA combines strategies used in the commercial gaming environment with lessons from educational research on learning and motivation. It allows users to travel to virtual places to perform educational activities (known as Quests), talk with other users and mentors, and build virtual personae. A Quest is an engaging curricular task designed to be entertaining yet educational&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Quest takes the form of a narrative based adventure and there is a novel called &#8220;Archfall&#8221; which leads students into the narrative and therefore eventually the role play through narrative that forms the Quest Atlantis World.<\/p>\n<h3>Useful Communities<\/h3>\n<p>[<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nate.org.uk\/\">www.nate.org.uk<\/a>]<\/p>\n<p>The National Association for the teaching of English has plenty of books and references about using story telling in classrooms.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2simple software 2Create a Story Enables young children to make interactive multi media stories.
