During the 2008-2009 school year, 79 teachers from 50 schools throughout the country participated in independent studies regarding the effect of Promethean technology on student achievement. The study was conducted in two phases. Phase I involved an analysis of student learning with and without Promethean technology as it relates to demographic information and teacher self-reported experience with the technology. Phase II involved an analysis of student learning with and without Promethean technology as it relates to teacher behaviors as evidenced in videotapes of teachers using the technology in their classrooms.<\/p>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.prometheanworld.com\/upload\/pdf\/Final_Report_on_ActivClassroom_%282%29.pdf\">The Marzano Report (PDF)<\/a><\/li>\n<p>A Futurelab report on the key findings of the ways in which IWBs are used, the optimum conditions for effective use; the factors that may support such use; the aspects that may influence future developments; as well as the types of evidence needed that will enable the implementation of appropriate changes.<\/p>\n<ul><a href=\"http:\/\/www.prometheanworld.com\/upload\/pdf\/Final_Report_on_ActivClassroom_%282%29.pdf\"> <\/a><\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.futurelab.org.uk\/resources\/documents\/other\/whiteboards_report.pdf\">Interactive Whiteboards in the Classroom<\/a> (PDF)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Links:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.six.somerset.gov.uk\/somhtml\/7\/somweb\/whitebrdeval.htm\">An evaluation of IWB in the classroom: Somerset LA<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interactive_whiteboard\">A minimal (but interesting) summary from Wikipedia<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Interactive whiteboard evaluation: Developing the use of interactive whiteboards in mathematics An evaluation of the use of interactive whiteboards in mathematics classrooms was undertaken at the beginning of 2006 by Keele University for the Secondary National Strategies.
