  <h2>Paper given to the European Society, King's College</h2>
  <h3>London Friday 2nd February 2007</h3>
  <p>Introduction</p>
  <p>Thanks for invitation. Opening comments</p>
  <p>The question asks: &#8220;Is the Constitutional Treaty the first step to
    democracy? - and to discuss (implicitly) the democratic deficit? - and the
    future of the Treaty? </p>
  <p>The plan is to concentrate on aspects of the institutions of the EU and
    the same for a vision of Europe</p>
  <p>My name was put forward by an office holder of the European Movement and
    of the Federal Union. Members, while for the process of integration in Europe,
    are not necessarily unanimous as to how that process should develop.</p>
  <p>At a recent meeting of the Federal Trust, for example, Professor Vernon
    Bogdanor put forward a well-argued case for the greater role of the European
    Parliament. It would confirm the appointment of the Commissioners and censor
    individual Commissioners for defective behaviour as required.</p>
  <p>The business of the evening concerns (1) the future of the Constitutional
    Treaty and (2) asks for a personal vision for the future of Europe.</p>
  <p>The Constitutional Treaty: Is it the first step towards democracy? No, it
    is not: however, it is a further step towards fully democratically accountable
    European institutions. </p>
  <p>Democracy &#8211; parliamentary democracy - was implicit in the process
    of creating the EU, starting with the Coal and Steel Community, implemented
    in 1951. Its main aims were peace, economic recovery and security. It did
    not require referendums to pioneer all this. It also carried with it the
    implicit support and confidence of a people in Europe that sought peace and
    recovery.</p>
  <p>The Community idea developed from the multi-government conference in Messina
    in 1955 and, via the Treaty of Rome in 1957, got as far as the IGC at Maastricht
    in 1991-2; this was the point where these aims had largely been attained:
    perceived as a change of type from Community to Union.</p>
  <p>The core membership of 6 countries had after 1973, through a process of
    enlargement, grown to 9 &#8211; and it would progress through to 27 in 2007:
    three times the number. Such a change in the order of magnitude necessitated
    modified rules: Hence the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
  <p>Likewise, the Maastricht Treaty was seen by the new members, specifically
    the Irish Republic and the Kingdom of Denmark, as being of domestic constitutional
    significance. It was a change in &#8220;qualitude&#8221; and called for ratification
    by referendum. Explicit democracy.</p>
  <p>President Mitterrand exercised his option to submit the Treaty to the opinion
    of the people of France. There were thus three referendums. The people of
    Denmark voted narrowly against the Treaty. A second vote gained a narrow
    majority through the new concept of the national &#8220;opt-out&#8221; &#8211; for
    example, the UK and Denmark from the euro.</p>
  <p>The role of a referendum is: either as a constitutional obligation, or exclusion,
    as in the German Federal Republic, or it is the option of a head of a government
    to exploit as a balance of judgement.</p>
  <p>A UK prime minister has 3 times offered it to the electorate. The promise
    of a referendum was successfully held by Harold Wilson in 1975. In 1998 and
    in 2003 Tony Blair promised a referendum; but on both occasions he simply
    abandoned the idea. In effect, the people of France decided against the Treaty
    on behalf of both France and the UK. The people of the Netherlands decided
    for themselves.</p>
  <p>So how has democracy developed in the EU so far? We went through a period
    of the &#8216;implicit&#8217; between 1957 and 1992. We are now in the phase
    of the &#8216;explicit&#8217;. The EU has helped to highlight all this in
    the collective European mind, while largely respecting local custom.</p>
  <p>Even at the European level, it is the member states that agree to the 5-year
    Parliamentary period and to the futility of alternating sessions between
    Brussels and Strasbourg. However, they cannot agree to hold the EP elections
    on the same day of the week, nor on the electoral process for the selection
    and election of MEPs. Hence the unique system used in the UK.</p>
  <p>Even in this tangle &#8211; entirely the responsibility of the governments
    of the member states in their pursuit of &#8220;Sovereignty&#8221; &#8211; we
    see the one institution of the EU that has democratic legitimacy: the European
    Parliament itself.</p>
  <p>The Council of Ministers represents the appropriate national departments
    of government: this is a form of indirect democracy. Each minister is elected,
    selected and appointed nationally. In theory, this also means being answerable
    to the national parliament. The EU role is thus an extension of the national
    responsibility. The mandate is national not European.</p>
  <p>The main institution of the EU is the Commission. Again it is a national
    prime minister who appointments each national Commissioner. The democratic
    process is by patronage and totally indirect. In my view, for the UK, wrong
    as a system.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, I understand that the Republic of Ireland takes all this
    very seriously and appoints of its best available candidates. The success
    of Ireland in the EU comes from a positive attitude to the EU &#8211; partly
    attributable to being independent of the UK! The people of Scotland have
    noticed!</p>
  <p>The UK only appears to do this. The late Lord Cockfield was a classic example.
    He was thought to be a &#8220;Russell Bretherton&#8221; (Our man from the
    Board of Trade representing the UK as an observer at Messina). In fact his,
    Lord Cockfield&#8217;s, astute brain and pursuit of detail led to the implementation
    Single European Act &#8211; and typically his subsequent replacement by Lord
    Brittan.</p>
  <p>Both should have been Commissioners in their own right.</p>
  <p>Thus far the development of the current constitutional status of the EU
    has seen the parallel emergence of three types of democracy: the implicit,
    explicit and indirect &#8211; patronage, even!</p>
  <p>That is my answer to the first part of the question. The process of designing
    and ratifying the Constitutional Treaty exposes the differences between the
    political cultures of the member states - as expressed by the different governments
    and their vested interests.</p>
  <p>I submit that the national governments exaggerate the differences between
    the people of Europe. As the measure of opinion polls showed in 2003 over
    the Anglo-American war against Iraq, that public opinion across Europe was
    much of one voice: It was the national governments that were the problem.</p>
  <p>That neatly leads on to the vision of the future of Europe &#8211; that
    is how the main institutions of the EU might be reformed and developed.</p>
  <p>Let us take them in turn:</p>
  <p>The Councils of Ministers should reflect their true identity and work closely
    with their national parliaments in the scrutiny of EU Legislation - one of
    the recommendations of the Treaty. For example, in the UK this would oblige
    the House of Commons to &#8220;do better&#8221; in its review of EU legislation.
    MPs are have other motivations.</p>
  <p>In fact it is the special committees of the House of Lords that do a thorough
    job in the scrutiny of EU legislation. Their lord- and lady-ships fulfil
    an important function of state through their expertise and commitment. Long
    may it remain through whatever reforms come about at the UK or English level! </p>
  <p>We should now consider the future of the European Parliament: my starting
    point is the example of the Jenkins Report of 1998 and its proposed reforms
    for the UK electoral system. Not in the interest of the Prime Minister, so,
    like the referendums: dumped!</p>
  <p>The appeal of this Report is that it recommends a combination of single
    member constituencies; it is designed to produce a result with the number
    of seats allocated in proportion to the pattern of electoral voting through
    a member list system. The EP at the EU level is fine &#8211; it is the UK
    voting system that is the main problem. One vote for nine candidates is a
    nonsense. This shows contempt for the electorate.</p>
  <p>My main recommendation concerns the Commission and the Commissioners. It
    and they lack a mandate (I quote Vernon Bogdanor again). The process of their
    selection and appointment is currently at the behest of the nation state,
    its government, but not its people. Indirect democracy through patronage.</p>
  <p>So I will put forward a straightforward proposal: That the number of Commissioners
    be limited to 7 and with specific departmental responsibilities for only
    those tasks best performed at the European level. I suggest 7 to be an ideal
    number for an effective committee or cabinet meeting. They would be elected
    on a European scale. I commend this as a principle at this stage, perhaps
    for discussion later.</p>
  <p>This process of direct election would link the people to the European level
    of decision-making and oblige the candidates to declare a mandate based on
    their professional qualification in a specific area of expertise, addressed
    to all the people of Europe.</p>
  <p>The weakness in the present system is that the Commission is not always
    in touch with the public mood, with national concerns (the referendum in
    Ireland and the Commission intervening on a matter of EU public finance)
    and particular local issues &#8211; cheese making in Cheshire, abattoirs,
    sweet shops in Oxted etc.</p>
  <p>In short they are inhibited from direct contact with the &#8216;ground level&#8217; implications
    of their actions and decisions. The matter of timing is also important. Perhaps
    the Commission and the Commissioners do get things right most of the time.
    They are unable to communicate direct to the people. Their mandate is based
    on a divided loyalty.</p>
  <p>Being dependent on the motivations of the national politicians and local
    media, the blunders and indiscretions of the few are news; the good work
    of the many passes like ships in the night. Communication is an important
    factor.</p>
  <p>This straightforward proposal &#8211; for a limited number of &#8220;Director
    Commissioners&#8221; would advance the progression of democracy and mandate
    accountability at the European level.</p>
  <p>It would help to define the key roles of the individuals and the institutions
    that serve the people of Europe. It would simultaneously define the people
    of Europe as a coherent Community; it would address the vision and commitment
    of the founders of the process of European integration: peace, economic development
    and security &#8211; at peace with ourselves.</p>
  <p>It would also unlock the minds of both the rulers and the ruled of Europe;
    it would get us out of this prolonged period of reflexion into the realms
    of decision and action. It would expose the self-serving mentality of local
    politicians. That is the nature of the human being. As a sales manager once
    told me: &#8220;It is essential to identify what it is that really motivates
    people.&#8221;</p>
  <p>I simply ask that we all to think and understand the importance of decision
    making at the European level. The motivation would be to serve a European
    electorate: a European community.</p>
  <p>It would prove that European politics is the property of her people - we/us,
    the Europeans. It would prove, above all, that, to paraphrase Harold Macmillan: &#8220;European
    politics can be fun!&#8221;</p>
  <p>That is my vision of Europe for my 2 grandsons. I shall not live to see
    it, but what fun to think that either or both could one day become a Director
    of the European Commission in, say, 2030! And many of you may be voting for
    them!</p>
  <p>Or they may vote for you even sooner than that! Something to think about.
    Even to discuss.</p>
  <p>Thus I offer you the vision of true European democracy.</p>
