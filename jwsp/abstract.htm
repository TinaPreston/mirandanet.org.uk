<h2>A Study Of The Official Response Of The UK To European Integration Initiatives 
  1945-51 - A Pursuit Of The National Interest? </h2>
<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><em><strong>Key words:</strong> National Interest, Official Policy of the UK, Cripps, 
    Attlee, Bevin, Dalton, USA, Marshall, Monnet, Marjolin, Schuman, Sterling, 
    Empire, Europe, European Integration, Constitutional Initiative, Coal and 
    Steel Plan</em></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>The UK in 1945 found herself victorious in the European war, still with a vast 
  empire, dominant in the sterling currency and with an industrial base expanded 
  in response to the war and less destroyed than that on the Continent. Her people 
  were united as never before, and ruler reconciled with the ruled through a decisive 
  result at the first post-war election.</p>
<p>The purpose of the study is to discover why a nation with all that going for 
  it ignored the obvious lesson of recent history and went into denial about Europe 
  and a state of dependence on the USA. The new government under Clement Attlee 
  pursued a policy of welfare reform, investment combined with nationalization 
  over industry and negotiated with the USA for a continuation of her wartime 
  relationship of financial support and harmonization of foreign policy. This 
  became the more important with the perception of Soviet political advances into 
  central Europe allied to subversive pressure on western Europe.</p>
<p>The post-war period might have been an opportunity for the UK to take the initiative 
  and herself lead the advance of European Integration. The offer of Marshall 
  Aid presumed in many respects that the UK through the ECE and OEEC with responsibility 
  for the European scale of the Recovery Programme. In fact, Ernest Bevin reacted 
  enthusiastically, joined up with Bidault, his counterpart in France, and pioneered 
  the Paris Conference within 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Whereas such as Monnet, Schuman and Marjolin provided constitutional plans 
  for the future of Europe, the UK reacted with barely concealed reluctance at 
  the official level. The word skepticism was not used but its existence was in 
  instant play as far as 'Europe' was concerned. Bevin, with some understanding 
  from Sir Stafford Cripps, Chancellor of the Exchequer, was otherwise alone in 
  a Cabinet headed by Attlee, himself with little regard for the 'the Continental 
  Method'.</p>
<p>The purpose of the exercize is to construct a version of the UK National Interest. 
  The primary source is the PRO at Kew: the exchange of papers within and between 
  the Foreign Office, the Treasury, the Board of Trade and the Offices of the 
  Prime Minister and the Cabinet. A literature review has so far simply confirmed 
  the general observation but not yet hypothesized the argument for the construct 
  of the UK National Interest.</p>
<p>So far the research shows an official machine working well at the managerial 
  and operational level. All the rules and procedures are observed. Correctness 
  abounds. However, there is a clear mismatch between the UK and French pattern 
  of thought. It is a philosophical problem. Monnet produces a general, political 
  and constitutional type plan; Sir Sydney Caine, for one, produces a report based 
  on alternative customs controls and the price and production forecasts for the 
  next 4 years. Coal and steel are included.</p>
<p>In spite of an education system purporting to inspire leadership and initiative, 
  its 'sons' appear to reveal neither when the word 'Europe' 
  is on the agenda. The National Interest of the UK is thus pursued.</p>
<p>The aim of the research is to clarify the impression formed thus far, correct 
  it where possible, and to put it all into the broader perspective of the major 
  concerns of the UK at that time: the economy was in bad shape, the agreements 
  with the USA were revoked at Bretton Woods, the Empire was running at a loss 
  - it would lose share of world markets as the European economies recovered. 
  The "Wind of Change" had already started to blow, with India as its 
  first liberatee. </p>
<p>Furthermore the USA was in practical if not emotional terms hostile to the 
  British Empire, cynical about sterling and ambivalent if not ambiguous about 
  the role of the UK in Europe. Indeed, a successful Europe would have to be cornered 
  by Federal policy; to that extent the influence of Soviet expansionism was not 
  all a bad thing. The USA was ambitious for itself.</p>
<p>Thus the UK pursued an independent domestic welfare and industrial policy; 
  this alarmed the leaders of the USA; it set up a course of economic policy that 
  was out of harmony with that of the Continent. Research into the way in which 
  the officials in the UK administration pursued the National Interest should 
  reveal a lack of strategic thinking in need of inspired leadership - made 
  all the more complicated by a concealed level of self awareness.</p>
