  <h2>Innovation for community regeneration: bridging the digital divide</h2>
  <p>In the Minerva Programme's Web@Classroom project, teachers, students and 
    researchers at schools in Portugal, Spain, Ireland, and the United Kingdom 
    have worked together collaboratively to use wireless technology in innovative 
    ways. They have maintained e-mail contact, exchanging information, ideas and 
    cultural detail which has encouraged discussion and promoted greater cross 
    cultural understanding which the students, in particular, have valued. As 
    one 11-year-old student said: <em>&quot;We can all learn about other countries 
    and the way people live&quot;</em>.</p>
  <p>In the UK primary school, the use of laptops allowed the students to have 
    greater access to a computer in order to work individually. Previously, there 
    had been limited access to an old computer suite or to a single stand-alone 
    computer in the classroom. This made it very difficult for a whole class to 
    be set an ICT task. Using the laptops and the wireless technology, as one 
    teacher explained: <em>&quot;We often see students (in yr. 6) walking around 
    the school with a laptop, making measurements or conducting a survey and inputting 
    the data as they go. It has made the ICT much more accessible. The student's 
    skills have improved so much that they have much higher than expected skills, 
    especially compared to students from other schools, when they move on to their 
    secondary school.&quot;</em></p>
  <p>Access to the technology and a network of support has emerged as critical 
    factors supporting change. The head teacher explained <em>&quot;Its part of 
    being part of the school, wanting to show the children that we're all learners. 
    I don't mind going to ask someone if I can't do something on a laptop. We 
    try to promote that openness so that they don't feel threatened when they 
    don't know, then they're more likely to ask. Again, through the laptops, ICT 
    has helped us to become a true learning organisation.&quot;</em></p>
  <h2>Community regeneration</h2>
  <p>The school's ICT initiative in the UK is to build a connected learning community 
    in an area of considerable social and economic deprivation. The aim is can 
    provide a model for bridging the digital divide through facilitating collaboration 
    between the school and its local community to support not only the learning 
    of children, but lifelong learning for the whole community. The headteacher 
    had a clear vision; <em>&quot;I discovered issues such as the digital divide 
    which divides society. We felt that if we could bridge that divide, some of 
    the other social exclusion issues could start to be addressed&quot;</em>.</p>
  <p>Access to laptops was provided at school and at home and is raising the profile 
    of learning in the community. The head teacher reported &quot;the parents 
    felt quite complimented that we thought they were worth the investment because 
    they were taking this high tech expensive kit home and we were saying to them 
    'you are worth it'.&quot; </p>
  <p>E-mentors from industry were enlisted to provide online support and encouragement 
    for pupils who may not have a male role model in the family. An E-learning 
    foundation provided laptops through a low cost scheme. The laptop initiative 
    has facilitated parents learning about ICT, and encouraged parents' ICT skills 
    and confidence, raising their self-esteem. Parents and grandparents were undertaking 
    ICT courses provided through adult education courses run at the school and 
    encouraged to build on them by continuing at higher education centres in the 
    area. Certificates to recognise their achievements were presented in the school 
    assembly. </p>
  <p>The head teacher explained <em>&quot;once the laptops started to go home, 
    the parents became interested in the new technology. They didn't feel threatened 
    by it because it was in their own home. They were coming to school saying 
    'my year 4 child knows more than me' etc. We could tell them about the ICT 
    courses for adults and they would come along.&quot;</em> The overall effect 
    was to raise the profile of learning in the community and to provide a network 
    of support for pupils and parents learning together. The evidence shows that 
    61% of pupils borrowing a laptop received help with their work from family 
    or friends. 46 out of 47 pupils borrowing laptops reported that family and 
    friends also used the laptop. ICT has been a catalyst for positive change 
    in parent and pupil attitudes to school, schoolwork and to homework.</p>
