  <p><strong>Teacher benefits</strong><br>
    The majority of teachers could see the positive pedagogical outcomes of integrating 
    ICT into the curriculum. The school ethos of sharing ICT skills and providing 
    training for teachers, as well as the use of laptops at home, is giving teachers 
    the foundation to incorporate ICT across the curriculum. However, teachers 
    would like greater access to technology for pupils at all times, not only 
    timetabled sessions in the computer room. ICT &quot;can aid teachers in getting 
    to the heart of the learning objective they are trying to teach.&quot; (UK 
    teacher)</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="UK_leading_ideas.jpg" width="260" height="195" alt="UK_leading_ideas.jpg"></p>
  <p><strong>Pupil Motivation</strong><br>
    Teachers and pupils report that the impact of ICT has been substantial on 
    pupil attitudes to learning: One teacher said &quot;the motivation and the 
    way the children concentrate is the biggest value for me.&quot; The Head teacher 
    said ICT had positively affected all the children's learning. Teachers said 
    that children with special educational needs could produce high quality outcomes 
    using ICT, which raised the pupils' self esteem and raised the profile of 
    learning and achievement. </p>
  <p><strong>Organisation of the Lap tops</strong><br>
    Each class is timetabled to use the laptops twice a week so teachers don't 
    need to book them in advance. The wireless connectivity of the laptops solved 
    the issue of pupils storing and retrieving individual work files, as pupils' 
    work and school resources could be saved onto the schools network and accessed 
    remotely via the wireless connection.</p>
  <p>&quot;The head has lent (lap tops) out to teachers on a semi permanent loan 
    arrangement. If a teacher wants a laptop they have access to one at home as 
    well.&quot; (UK teacher)</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="organisational_advantages.jpg" width="283" height="212" alt="organisational_advantages.jpg"></p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Efficiency, saving time on production</strong><br>
    Once teachers possessed ICT skills, the production and storage of resources 
    was significantly aided by the technology. Also the electronic submission 
    of teachers' lessons plans every two weeks facilitated sharing and editing 
    curriculum activities between teachers.</p>
  <p>&quot;We do our planning on the laptops. We also do the end of year reports 
    on the computers and we tend to keep all the schools records on the computers 
    and do the analysis. I find it easier to keep things on the computer, it's 
    easier to find it and to make changes.&quot; (UK teacher)</p>
  <p>&quot;I think more and more teachers are using more and more ICT in their 
    planning...the head has told us that he wants all the planning to be computerised 
    within the next 12 months. Our reports have been computerised over the past 
    couple of years. I know that the head will be asking us to upload all of the 
    resources we produce onto the schools intranet or our Internet site.&quot; 
    (UK teacher)</p>
  <p><strong>Teachers' professional development and collaboration</strong> <br>
    Teachers have access to formal and informal support networks for providing 
    ICT skills. These networks included training courses at school, colleagues, 
    family and friends. Access to the technology and a network of support has 
    emerged as critical factors supporting change. One teacher said &quot;The 
    ICT coordinator has set up some ICT training sessions for those teachers and 
    teaching assistants who don't feel comfortable using the laptops, those are 
    building up people's skills and confidence. &quot; The head teacher explained 
    &quot;Its part of being part of the school, wanting to show the children that 
    we're all learners. I don't mind going to ask someone if I cant do something 
    on a laptop. We try to promote that openness so that they don't feel threatened 
    when they don't know, then they're more likely to ask. Again, through the 
    laptops, ICT has helped us to become a true learning organisation.&quot; </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="UK_why_use_laptops.jpg" width="281" height="117" alt="UK_why_use_laptops.jpg"> 
  </p>
  <p><strong>Pedagogical practices</strong><br>
    The availability of laptops has enabled teachers to plan lessons and curriculum 
    activities that not only integrated ICT into the classroom, but also enhanced 
    the pupils' learning by focusing on the learning outcomes. Teachers used a 
    variety of software such as word processing, presentations, spreadsheets and 
    specialist software. One very enthusiastic teacher explained &quot;the laptops 
    can enable the teacher to focus on the learning objectives. I think for example 
    of a newspaper article. I produced a template in a desktop publisher. The 
    children could get straight into typing the newspaper article. I was able 
    to focus more on writing in the style of a newspaper reporter&quot;. Another 
    teacher enthused &quot;We use a lot of PowerPoint. The children really like 
    writing things in PowerPoint, animating and putting sounds on; they love doing 
    that. I teach them to do it like a book they do a contents page with slides 
    that link to the different contents. We do a lot of word processing work writing 
    stories and editing it. We do spreadsheet work, teaching them how to do graphs, 
    using the wizard to produce the graphs and then we put callouts on to interpret 
    the graphs. I find this useful; because when pupils do a pencil and paper 
    graph, it takes them forever to get it laid out right and they've had no time 
    to interpret it. With Excel they put the data in and within a second they 
    have a graph and they are starting to interpret it, once they have the ICT 
    skills of course.&quot;</p>
  <p>The laptops were timetabled into specific lessons, which enabled teachers 
    to plan ICT into those lessons. Consequently teachers had guaranteed access 
    and would build ICT into the curriculum. One UK teacher stated &quot;each 
    teacher has a responsibility to use computers and teach the curriculum.&quot;</p>
  <p>The collaborative web@classroom project with partner schools in Europe facilitated 
    and encouraged the use of the Internet for curriculum work.</p>
  <p> Innovation for community regeneration: bridging the digital divide.<br>
    The U.K school's ICT initiative, to build a connected learning community in 
    an area of considerable social and economic deprivation, provided a model 
    for bridging the digital divide through facilitating collaboration between 
    the school and its local community to support not only the learning of children, 
    but lifelong learning for the whole community. Access to laptops was provided 
    at school and at home is raising the profile of learning in the community. 
  </p>
  <p>The head teacher said &quot;I discovered issues such as the digital divide 
    which divides society. We felt that if we could bridge that divide, some of 
    the other social exclusion issues could start to be addressed&quot;. He also 
    reported &quot;the parents felt quite complimented that we thought they were 
    worth the investment because they were taking this high tech expensive kit 
    home and we were saying to them 'you are worth it'.&quot; </p>
  <p>E-mentors from industry were enlisted to provide online support and encouragement 
    for pupils who may not have a male role model in the family. An E-learning 
    foundation provided laptops through a low cost scheme. The laptop initiative 
    has facilitated parents learning about ICT, and encouraged parents' ICT skills 
    and confidence, raising their self esteem. Parents and grandparents were undertaking 
    ICT courses provided through adult education courses run at the school and 
    encouraged to build on them by continuing at higher education centers in the 
    area. Certificates to recognize their achievements were presented in the school 
    assembly. The head teacher explained &quot;once the laptops started to go 
    home, the parents became interested in the new technology. They didn't feel 
    threatened by it because it was in their own home. They were coming to school 
    saying 'my year 4 child knows more than me' etc. We could tell them about 
    the ICT courses for adults and they would come along.&quot; The overall effect 
    was to raise the profile of learning in the community and to provide a network 
    of support for pupils and parents learning together. The evidence shows that 
    61% of pupils borrowing a laptop received help with their work from family 
    or friends. 46 out of 47 pupils borrowing laptops reported that family and 
    friends also used the laptop. ICT has been a catalyst for positive change 
    in parent and pupil attitudes to school, schoolwork and to homework.</p>
