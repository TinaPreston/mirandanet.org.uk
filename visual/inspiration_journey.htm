  <h2>An Inspirational Journey - Development Issues in introducing new technology
    into learning environments</h2>
  <p>Christina Preston has been interviewing MirandaNet Fellow Michael Smith
    on-line about his path to discovering the power of technology
    in the
    classroom.
    He called this path an 'Inspiration Journey', hence Tina's first question.</p>
  <h4>1. Why did you call this an Inspiration Journey?</h4>
  <p>Well my involvement in developing use of ICT has been a journey of discovery.
    My first introduction to the interactive nature of ICT and how it can and
    facilitates collaborative learning was on an Open University course, using
    email to discuss issues with Tutor and student colleagues. Later I joined
    several MirandaNet workshops to develop e-facilitation skills and it was
    in doing this that I formulated ideas about e- learning.. By this I mean
    learning in new ways made possible by the use of ICT. Forums are a powerful
    way of sharing ideas with others and e-facilitating forums for the GTC website
    and in the classroom, particularly in teaching citizenship was inspirational.
    It opened my eyes to the fact that in such a democratic digital learning
    style of the forum, one was transforming the educational processes of the
    normal classroom. In a forum one has a learning community, which develops
    is own conduct of operation and where the &#8216;teachers&#8217; become learners
    and vice versa as ideas are shares, reacted to and developed. The environment
    is not bounded by the walls of the classroom; there are no hierarchies, participants
    seemed eager to express ideas. Also through further MirandaNet workshops
    and online discussions I was introduced to Inspiration, a software package
    that enables one to set out ideas in a visual manner. Inspiration is an excellent
    word for this software ... you begin to look at communicating in a different
    way. This is a visual non-linear environment and with this my journey has
    now taken on another dimension - moving away from standard linear representation
    of ideas. </p>
  <h4>2. How important do you consider visual representation to be important to
    learning.</h4>
  <p>We tend not to think and discover in a linear fashion. Mapping out ideas
    visually allows one the freedom to show links, tangents and allows complexity
    to be shown quickly and although it sounds odd to say - simply. Also a visual
    map of ideas or the representation perhaps of an academic paper of chapters
    of the conventionally linear book, allow the person interacting with such
    a framework to follow their own path through and more easily take their own
    voyage through. Visual learning environments, I believe makes material immediately
    accessible, perhaps less challenging, daunting and feedback from those who
    experience learning in this way convinces me that most people enjoy this
    approach. Imagine how visuals for example would enhance the linearity and
    rather sometimes mundane look of forum threads. You could represent the complex
    threads more easily. Participants could have pictures, they could add diagrams,
    as well as words, making the them a sensory rich and more exciting environment.
    We have their opportunity for real pedagogical change here and in this way
    ICT really adds value to the learning process.</p>
  <h4>3. You mentioned that ICT can bring about pedagogical change and add value,
    could you explain how you see this taking place.</h4>
  <p>We do things in different ways. The classroom walls expand and can include
    the globe. We can form and change into learning communities for different
    tasks. There is no rule which says the teacher has sole control of information
    and therefore learning. Rather a becomes a facilitator, providing a framework,
    goals, the learners have access easier access to information and more freedom
    to follow their individual needs and styles of expression. The teacher is
    not at the front of the classroom, different learners have the opportunity
    to lead as they interact. The technology simply makes this easier. I think
    we are at the start of an exciting journey here. I am beginning to learn
    how to use ICT to make learning more interactive and therefore have enhanced
    meaning for those involved. An important element for me is moving from a
    world of bullet points, linearly organised power points slides, consecutive
    chapters of linear text in a book to a visually rich, multi media environment.
    Let us take a standard view of an academic paper or text for example. We
    see a linear set of heading or contents page. If this is shown as a visual
    framework of concepts, with hyperlinks to diagrams, internet sites, video,
    podcasts and so on we have something which is more exciting and flexible
    to use. Those interacting are not straight jacketed by the editing of the
    book,, they can access the ideas and information in exactly the why they
    wish to. Imagine combing such a book or paper with a forum in which you can
    interact with the writer and others reading the material. This is how the
    technology adds value.</p>
  <h4>4. Why did you use the word Icons to describe one section of your presentation?</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Follow the rest of this discussion on the <a href="https://www.mirandanet.org.uk/phorum/default.php?read,32,2151"><strong>MirandaNet
      Forum</strong></a> </li>
    <li>The thread is called: <strong>Why did you call your
        professional experience of visual learning an Inspirational Journey,
        Michael?</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you want to join in, it's best if you register yourself on the forum,
    and then you can edit your own posts. There are easy-to-follow instructions
    on the forum.</p>
  <h4>5.
      How far is the visual play a part of what you called e-learning philosophy?</h4>
  <h4>6. Whilst visual representation can provide striking images and a user friendly
    pathway through complex ideas, how can a more than two dimensional view be
    obtained. How can background information, interaction, detail and a 3D view
    be obtained.</h4>
  <h4>7. What can the visual non linear approach offer over and above the linear?</h4>
  <h4>8. Are there any problems with adopting a highly visual approach to presenting
    ideas?</h4>
  <h4>9. What other visual techniques did you use other than Inspiration.</h4>
  <h4>10 Do you have any advice to give those who would like to adopt a more visual
    approach to the way they present ideas.</h4>
  <h4>11. What audience feedback have you had?</h4>
  <h4>12. What will you be looking at next?</h4>
