Preston }{\f4\ul Apple to Zap Handbook of Literacy for Learners of all Ages}{\f4  (July 1994) Apple Publications}}}{\f4  Professor Gunther Kress warns us that it is impossible to overstate the enormity of changes in literacy and literacy practices wrought by developments in electronic technologies.  This revolution, he maintains is more far-reaching, and more fundamental than Gutenberg's invention of the printing press. Gutenburg did not disturb what was understood about written language: its formality; its impersonality; its objectiveness and \lquote timelessness\rquote ; its grammatical complexities; its hierarchical mode of organisation. But technology is now challenging these notions - for instance, the geographic separation and temporal co-presence of two people interacting via electronic mail. \par \par This challenge of the new communications media also has a deeply subversive potential in relation to language. While Gutenberg\rquote s revolution made language in its written form more central, the current revolution is taking us both backwards and forwards into a new era of iconic forms of communication, backwards and forwards into hieroglyphics. The emphasis is on the visual. In a new multi-modal, multi-media form of text, what is happening is a fundamental challenge to the hitherto unchallenged cultural centrality of written language. \par \par In some ways we are returning to a medieval manuscript and early print culture where books were rare, copying was current, authorship was not important, reading aloud and listening were the main forms of information distribution and varied international orthography was acceptable. As the power of the book as an information authority is weakened our society is  adding to these medieval conventions:  the death of copyright, collaborative composition and changeable texts.}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{ }{\fs18 Chandler and Marcus - }{\fs18\ul Education and Computers }{\fs18 Harrap (1989)}}}{\f4   This is indeed a revolution which is central to what we learn and teach in our schools. Only the commitment of people like us will ensure that the computer is used as creative and empowering catalyst for the betterment of life not an excuse for the reduction of all human activity to the binary system: yes or no, black or white, male or female. Life is irreducible as we all sense, feel, intimate -  and the best computer practice }{\b\f4 can}{\f4  reflect these facts of life.   \par \par }{\b\f4 Computers and Ms Average}{\f4 \par \par It never seems to take people very long after meeting me before they ask rather belligerently, \ldblquote How on earth did you get into computing?\rdblquote  It is clear to me that I fall short in some way from the stereotype of what people in computing ought to be like.  I\rquote m not sure if it\rquote s because I write poetry, because I talk a lot or because I do not own an anorak. I may represent the average woman but I am, it seems, the antithesis of a proper computer person.\par \par This is borne out by the problems I had filling in the forms to be a Women into Information Technology Foundation (WIT) speaker or a member of the British Computer Society (BCS). The WIT form asks about my responsibilities in data processing and my training in systems analysis amongst other things. The BCS form requires a potted history of my competence in programming languages. Although I have been publishing material with the BCS schools committee for six years it is only in the last two years that this august body has been persuaded to number in their ranks people who cannot converse in Basic, \lquote C++\rquote  and FORTRAN. However,  I do seem to be clearing quite a few professional hurdles these days.  I have been 'certified' as an OFSTED inspector, worthy to inspect standards of information technology in schools - a role that will increase now that information technology stands as a core subject to be assessed with literacy and numeracy.  My work as a freelance journalist and publisher of classroom resources has recently been recognised in my election to the Society of Authors.\par \par My main role is as the  director of an industrially and government funded telematics project at the Institute of Education London University I have a variety of functions that include advice on software design with research, teacher education, the training of teacher trainers, the inspection of information technology in schools and support in telematics for developing countries. .\par \par So how did it all start?  My first encounter with computers was in the fifties. The imperious ringing of the telephone broke into my sleep at two in the morning. A throbbing taxi squatted in the road.  Hanging from the window, I saw my father, his pin striped pyjamas replaced by his pin striped suit, dashing out into the night like Dr. Findlay. Black bowler firmly on. The patient was the Citibank computer.  Down again!  \par \par The mysterious deletion of a couple of million pounds was the staple diet of breakfast conversation - computer fraud and security issues for our late, late, supper when he came home.  The computer seemed a voracious night and day devouror and regurgitator of information requiring constant attention, devotion and coaxing to perform.\par \par My father's bank was in Threadneedle Street  in the City of London.  Every Christmas the children of bank employees were invited to a spectacular party. Travelling through the grey and empty City streets on a Saturday was exciting in our new party dresses and our hair frizzled by curling tongs . The windowless buildings dwarfed us as we struggled up the marble steps. The Xmas party always lived up to expectations: the biggest tree, the most avuncular Father Xmas, the most sumptuous presents and the wobbliest jelly.. \par \par But there was a greater excitement in store one year. My father took my sister and I up in one of the lifts;  \ldblquote To see the computers.\rdblquote   In an antechamber, we pulled white gauze hats over our hair like operatives in a food factory. White plastic overshoes and stiff overalls signalled that dust and dandruff were the enemy. \par \par Secret codes were punched into the door panel.  Inside the room which was about 20 feet by 20 feet there were ten tin boxes the size of wardrobes. Through the window on their chests I could see giant brown tape reels whirling round.. These mainframe computers looked rather like the old reel to reel tape recorders that had eaten from the wrong side of the mushroom like Alice - and grown. There was a hallowed silence.  So this was the operations sanctum to which my father, the high priest, was called night and day.\par \par In the sixties and early seventies my adolescence and teacher training days were blissfully free of 'computer awareness'.  This has not changed much for student teachers today.  I have been keeping the figures for some years. Although BT and the Institute of Education can now assume that mature students will have some computing knowledge}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\f4  Mellar and Jackson- }{\f4\ul IT and entrants to teacher training }{\f4 Journal of Computer Assisted Learning \tab September(1993)\par Preston }{\f4\ul The BT Model }{\f4 - 1994 in progress}}}{\f4 , the large majority of initial teacher training institutions only have time for one or two days on computers in the year.  This absence of general information is not yet counterbalanced by a wider use in subject areas. As schools take over the full responsibility for teacher training it will be even harder to organise some degree of consistency in computer awareness. Let me remind you, nevertheless, that we remain world leaders in telematics in education in this country, with the possible exception of Holland. We also have the highest concentration of computers in the classroom with the exception of Iceland - but that's another story.\par \par The personal computer revolution found me in the early eighties when we bought a Spectrum 48K  for our growing children, a girl and a boy.  Games for children seemed to be the purpose of a home computer. I never actually touched the keyboard. On the first day of purchase we took it with great pride to show my father who had recently retired from Citibank.  Usually an obliging man, we were surprised when he refused, point-blank, to plug the little computer into his television. \par \par "How many K does it have?" he said, eyeing it warily, "48?  You remember the dust-proof data-processing centre I ran when you were still at school?  You remember all those life sized boxes?"  Of course I did.  \ldblquote Well in that entire room there was 30K of memory - and you're not putting 48K through my television set!"\par \par It was a graphic example of computer advance.  Nor was it just memory size.  My father reminded me of the lift I had travelled in to see the computers.  There were two lifts apparently and, on the odd occasion when they both left the ground floor simultaneously, the computer tapes stopped - some thing to do with the wiring. The tapes stopped on hot days, as well. And bugs? Well the story goes that the term 'program  bug' derived from the day when it was discovered that a cable chewing cockroach had been disrupting the operations of Wall Street mainframe. Bugs in coding are one thing, bugs in hardware quite another.\par \par In the seventies we thought we were past all that. Computers were so much more reliable and user friendly.  My children invested in a joystick so that they could kill little yellow people, the Green Berets or furry monsters with more efficiency.  They jet-setted with Willy and skied with Horace.  They went in for karate, kick boxing and diving with the Red Arrows.  I began to wish they would return to the television. \par \par In the early eighties my son's school held jumble sales and 'bring and buys' to purchase some ICL computers.   My daughter's school held a parents' evening for us to admire and use the new 'Pets'.  The young enthusiastic female head of the maths department extolled the virtues of women in the computer world and we, parents, were impressed.  My daughter brought home printouts of drawings and games programmed herself.  She began to leave the house early so that she could join her computer teacher at 8.00 a.m. - the only space for her year in the computer suite.  This stopped suddenly - the young and enthusiastic teacher had developed morning sickness - the Pets were abandoned.  Good computer teachers were thin on the ground in girls schools. \par \par By this time, at the large south London comprehensive where I taught English and Drama, there were computers only in the maths department.  So I was surprised to receive an invitation to a 2-day computer course at Kingston in May 1985 run by a body called The Microelectronics Programme (MEP). I was curious - how could computers have anything to do with English or Drama?\par \par Jean Beck, now a director at the National Council of Education Technology,  was in those days a down-to-earth advisor with MEP. Librarians have been a great unsung influence on the development of computer use in schools.  According to my research, Software in Schools}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\f4 Harris and Preston  }{\f4\ul Software in schools }{\f4 - NFER/NCET (1993)From NFER, The Mere, Slough, Berks.}}}{\f4 , librarians have led the way in CD-ROM and communications services. On this first morning Jean Beck gave us a brief run down on computer devices in the High Street.  She even told me that I would soon be getting my money from a hole in the wall.  \ldblquote Well,\rdblquote  I thought, \ldblquote a pleasant woman, but deluded\rdblquote .  \par \par The English heads of department on the MEP course were not very impressed by the couple of spelling programs, a multi-choice questionnaire on Hamlet and a rather explicit version of Hangman selected by a programming advisor. These titles were typical of educational programs written by teachers learning how to program in Basic.  The content of these programs was just a useful vehicle for justifying the programming exercise. These programs did have a place in establishing educational aspects of software but I would only recommend professional development today. Not that this debars teachers from the consultation process. \par \par The next day on the course Jean Beck introduced us to Bob Moy, the designer of 'Developing Tray'}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\fs18  Bob Moy  }{\fs18\ul Devtray  }{\fs18 and }{\fs18\ul Allwrite}{\fs18  Software published by ILECC, the Inner London Education Computing Centre. Closed down by Hammersmith Education Authority in March 1994}}}{\f4  and an ILEA advisor/teacher.  Bob was a teacher and a half. He introduced us to his program as if we were his class.  There were thirty of us and one computer used as an electronic blackboard. This was a program that we could see was based on learning theory.  The computer was adding to the learning process in a way that could not be replicated by conventional methods.  We were faced with a blank screen. We knew that there was a passage of writing to be discovered but we had no idea what it was.  We could buy or predict letters and punctuation. The computer would enter our predictions and tell us the score. \par \par Bob kept us in suspense.  He pretended absolute ignorance of what the passage really said. And we believed him.  We couldn't leave the puzzle alone; the text was perplexing and obscure: some poetry?  It was worth investigation.  We refused to cheat.  We were learning about language structure and styles from the bottom up.  At lunch time we all refused to leave for the pub. Sandwiches were ordered and we continued on our quest for meaning throughout the afternoon.\par \par Devtray has remained an important program for English teachers for a decade. I have seen it used badly and well over the years.  I have seen children merely guessing and I have seen them actively devising reading strategies.  It is typical of the kind of teaching tool that depends on the teachers\rquote  ability to use resources well. \par \par }{\b\f4 Computers in the Curriculum\par }{\f4 \par It was something of a surprise the next September to find 'IT' in four slots on my timetable.  \par \ldblquote What is IT?\rdblquote  I asked the curriculum deputy.  \par \ldblquote Information technology\rdblquote  he said patiently. \ldblquote You are teaching IT to two first year classes this year."\par \ldblquote Why me?\rdblquote  \par \ldblquote Because English teachers communicate well and because you had a two day MEP course on computers in May.\rdblquote \par \ldblquote Two days!\rdblquote  I squealed.\par \ldblquote Well it's two days more than anyone else teaching information technology this term.\rdblquote \par Remember at this point in time I had still never touched a keyboard. I\rquote m surprised I did not make more fuss but I was too ignorant to know what I was agreeing to.\par \par Actually the first term was easy as the computers had not arrived.  We taught the bemused classes from earnest, newly-minted Croydon information technology books.}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\fs18 Trisha Strong and Paul McGee }{\fs18\ul The Information Technology Project}{\fs18  MEP and Addison and Wesley ISDN 0 201 1550 9 (1984)}}}{\f4 We looked at traditional and modern methods of storing information and tried to see how much information was important to our lives.  We interpreted road signs, maps and timetables and learnt about using the computer for information retrieval, creating quizzes and learning to word process.  It all seemed very relevant and I just wished I had more training than the experience of life in this field.\par \par When the \u163\'a375,000 grant from the Manpower Services Commission finally was secured for a computer suite it was a difficult pill to swallow.  I didn't resent the money spent on computers - I thought it essential. But the roof of my classroom leaked and I had no lights or curtains in the drama studio.  So I did hope if the cake was small, the arts would not starve altogether.\par \par When the Research machines network of 186 computers was installed, I was promised training. We would be kept a week ahead of the students, we were assured. But, oh dear, the week we were to start turned out to be the first week of industrial action on the matter of directed time.  No training for me after all.\par \par Never mind.  The director of computing studies had stuffed a word processing manual in my overloaded pigeonhole with a note pinned to it which said, \ldblquote Teach this for the first six weeks.\rdblquote   He had also left instructions for turning the network on. Luckily one of the boys in my class seemed competent in operating the system.  I let him get on with it. For me, every plunge into the computer room felt like driving a different car out of the staff car park each night.  I had no opportunity to use a computer between the sessions with the pupils and they were not at all keen to let me have a whole keyboard to myself.  \par \par The night before the first class, I sat up late copying commands from the manual onto  flashcards.  The package was Word: tiny white letters on a black screen - remember- and a menu at the bottom that had impenetrable American commands like 'transfer'. We diligently typed, saved and printed. \par \par \ldblquote I'm bored, Miss,\rdblquote  said one of my charges after about two weeks of word processing procedures.\par \ldblquote So am I\rdblquote  I confessed. \ldblquote What do you suggest?\rdblquote \par They huddled together in conference.\par \ldblquote Why don't we use these computers to do some proper English?\rdblquote  one ventured.\par \ldblquote Yes, let\rquote s get back to writing about Chernobyl,\rdblquote  said another. \ldblquote That matters.\rdblquote \par \ldblquote We could use these machines to publish a sort of newspaper about the tragedy.\rdblquote \par \ldblquote Or a magazine... We could write letters about nuclear accident.\rdblquote \par \ldblquote Yes, they won\rquote t know the letters are from children if we use these computers. They might listen to us.\rdblquote  \par \par So we did learn the niceties of word-processing as we needed them, compelled by the need to communicate in the most professional way possible.  We were learning at our own pace.  Experts were emerging who were able to move the others on - new techniques spread like wild fire - soon we could all change fonts and sizes - check spelling - centre and justify. Jane Dorner}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\f4 Jane Dorner - Technology and Writers The British Library (1992)}}}{\f4  has made a study of authors which indicates that word-processing has changed their  style and approach to writing though this has been an incidental benefit of the professional pressure to use technology.   \par \par This early experience of computers in the classroom was formative. I have never since been persuaded to 'teach' word processing skills. In contrast I have found that a publication purpose is a great spur to learning in context.  In this context, I do object to education researchers who march children into a computer room for a limited amount of time and then conclude that word-processing makes no difference to them. Imagine if we tried to draw the same conclusions after limiting their access to pencils for one afternoon. Poor publishing results on noisy dot matrix printers has now made way for laser printers. The texts of authors and children look equally authoritative.  Authors have invented an acronym to describe the joys of laser production:  Lovely Authors\rquote  Script Evades Rejection.  In schools, rather like school uniform, laser printers are a great leveller allowing every child's work to be compared fairly with the rest. \par \par In that computing laboratory with the pupils  my teaching style changed for ever as well. I was used to commanding a class from the front like a keynote speaker - I could tell a good tale to keep them in their seats..  But the cables had been laid round the edge of the room.  Computer installation teams knew no better. As a random consequence, the children had their backs to me and they were totally absorbed, on task, committed - they did not need me. It was a tough moment of truth. \par \par We allowed the technicians to dictate the room layout until Deryn Watson}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\f4 Deryn Watson }{\f4\ul Developing CAL: Computers in the Curriculum}{\f4  Harper ISBN 0 06 318382-X  (1987)}}}{\f4 , pointed out that teaching methodology should take priority over technical convenience in the general scheme of things.  Nowadays an IT manager will take far more care over computer groupings. Some schools have designed computer rooms with mushroom workstations, cabling coming through the centre of the mushroom. What makes the difference now, of course, is the laptops which do not dominate a small classroom and  are portable enough for field trips.\par \par But faced by the pupils\rquote  backs in that south London computer lab, I reoriented myself and became facilitator and a learner . It was an exciting opportunity to explore the mechanics of good writing.   After I had overcome the initial terror at teaching a subject I was not trained in, I discovered students empowered and enthused by working at their own pace.  Each student was engaged in purposeful activity and I was free to sort out the real intellectual obstacles.  The machine reinforcement freed me to give more individual attention to pupils who were self-motivated. Reorganising text and correction were easier on the screen. Publication opportunities made pupils more concerned about accuracy:  a groups of girls nearly come to blows over a full stop.  .This was the kind of commitment in the classroom we were all searching for in the run up to the new GCSE courses.\par \par Just after Christmas that year an invitation from BT arrived asking me to join a team of teachers to design educational software at King\rquote s College, London University.  This was to involve me in an eighteen month project that published an adventure game, SCOOP, and a newsroom simulation, NEWSNET, teaching information technology in the classroom by practical methods.  But when the invitation first arrived I simply saw it as an opportunity to keep ahead of students who were, at the time, teaching me. \par \par My one-day secondment to Computers in the Curriculum at King\rquote s College was a whirlwind of activity on top of four days teaching without a free period.  But I began, at last, to learn in depth about educational computing.  The full-time associateship, sponsored by Croydon LEA the next year, was a welcome opportunity to use my co-ordination of the \lquote SCOOP' and 'NEWSNET'  design group as a reflective  experience.\par \par This major collaboration between industry and education began in 1985.  The Computers in the Curriculum project, based at the Centre for Educational Studies, King\rquote s College, London University, worked with the BT Education Service on a software project  that was planned to coincide with the DTI three year \u163\'a33.5 million scheme to encourage schools to buy software.  This project which was intended to widen the choice for schools cost  \u163\'a3200,000 and resulted in  six titles in science, technology,  information technology and English.}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\fs18\ul BT Educational Resources Catalogue }{\fs18 BT Education Services, BT Centre, 81 Newgate Street.

These groups were to work with telematics specialists in designing, specifying, developing the software.  Group co-ordinators were seconded from their schools for one day a week. Other teachers would be bought in to trial the material in the classrooms.  Co-ordinating the players was no small feat. The team numbered 46 people: programming teams, industrialist and educators}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\f4\ul C. Preston Computer Assisted Learning from the Coordinator's Perspective }{\f4 Centre for Educational Studies, Kings College, London University (1989)}}}{\f4 \par \par Leeds LEA had identified the need for telecommunications software for use in physics.  The teachers who joined this group were, by chance, all male science teachers.  Their shared subject gave them a united purpose and a clear understanding of what their subject required: signal transmission , pulse code modulation and picture manipulation  for sixth forms. \par \par Croydon LEA already had a track record in developing materials to teach the new subject information technology.  The project, therefore, attracted teachers across a range of subject specialisms and included both men and women.  As information technology was such a new subject and no-one in the group had the security of a formal training, it took us much longer to identify the subject matter that was appropriate. \par \par What we  were sure about was that we wanted to harness the motivation and concentration we had seen in children in computer games.  Eventually, using the theme of investigative journalism, we created an adventure game called Scoop and  an international  newsroom simulation called Newsnet.. \par \par In Scoop the student took the role of a journalist using on line information retrieval, fax, radio pagers to investigate a recluse millionaire and tell his story.  Yes, not millionairess - I realise we missed a trick but Croydon teachers were unversed in equal opportunities in the days when Croydon was a Tory flagship.  The theme of our second program, Newsnet, daughter of Scoop, indicates how much our own understanding of international journalism and IT had improved.  Each terminal represented a different country. The simulation was based on headlines for a simulated week. The more the journalists collaborated on electronic mail and  the more detail they uncovered in the databases, the nearer the truth they moved.\par \par I wrote an investigative novel into these three databases. Slick Cut, an international jet setting criminal, oiled through the data under a range of pseudonyms, putting his relatives in positions of power all over the world. As the student journalists uncovered information about his nefarious dealing the extent of his criminal operation became clearer. Eventually the pupil journalists would realise that the man who had rigged all kinds of activities internationally, was the same man who had bought the paper mills in Sweden that supplied the paper to the International  Gazette  group and the factory in South America that supplied the computer chips.  Just a little more digging and delving and they would discover that, yesterday, Slick Cut bought the International Gazette Group.  So what could they say about their owner? \par \par To be able to give students the experience of the pressures of ownership on writing was for me the highest level of learning that Newsnet could achieve.  But the computing skills they were learning were also not inconsiderable. Newsnet was the first educational integrated package. The user worked in an environment that linked three databases, desktop publishing, electronic mail, word processing and a networked wire service like Reuters. It was also the first educational program to use the communications facilities of a network as well.  As a result of the Newsnet design I have just been out in Chile developing a system of collaborative rural newspapers based on those ideas of eight years ago. }{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\fs18 C. Preston }{\fs18\ul Surfing the Net}{\fs18 , a multimedia interactive network for Chilean schools (1994) Paper in Progress }}}{\f4 \par \par Scoop was also technically innovative. The design emulated Microsoft windows on the BBC microcomputer. and was the biggest program ever designed for the BBC with twenty five picture locations.  \par \par This innovative style owes most to the programmer, Phil Wood. He had decided to use Assembler because Scoop promised to be so big.  Assembler is a low level language closest to the binary code which involved him in coding long series of numbers.  There was no prototyping or subroutines ten years ago in educational computing  If the teacher designers did not like the interface he had taken a month to write he would have to start all over again. One number in the new sequence wrong and the program would not function.  One day we arrived to find that he had programmed a story line left lying around from our meeting the month before.  He showed me that he had nearly reached the page turn.  "Why do you do this section, Phil?" I asked. "Because it was there," came the reply. I turned the page and showed him the other side.  "But Phil, this story line has no ending! We've rewritten the whole thing now!" He had to start again.\par \par It was a different approach that reminded me of a friend, a great mathematician, who used to crack radio codes at Cheltenham during the Cold War. She was very successful at cracking these codes. \ldblquote How exciting, Anne, what did the messages say?\rdblquote  I asked.  She looked at me blankly. \ldblquote Oh I never read them. I handed them on to someone else to do that!" \par \par The coding for Scoop took Phil eighteen months to complete. Using an HyperCard prototyping shell or and equivalent it would take about a fortnight today. The teachers donated nine months 'spare' time to the project  Political views have changed and teachers would no longer be prepared to give this commitment unpaid. However, there are now new strategies used in Project Miranda work to make the best of teachers' relevant experience without overloading their time. Professional development rewards are the key. \par \par After two years Scoop had sold ten times more than any comparable educational package. This commercial success was because BT supported a marketing and dissemination programme which allowed me to train teachers in information technology all over the country using Scoop as an illustration and a tool. Scoop has since been adapted by the Dutch government POCO project to use with a series of television programmes and national training workshops. \par \par Commercial success in educational software is difficult because the school base in this country is so small.  Much of the commercial material has American roots and displays the technical virtuosity of programming teams rather than interesting content. In the commercial world programmers intent on displaying their programming pyrotechnics will grab any little furry animal and any kind of Holy Grail to use as pegs. I have put out an SOS: "Where are Shakespeares Of Software?" to my colleagues in the Society of Authors and the Guild of Writers do not insist on getting involved.    Authors are beginning to respond. In fact, the help of a few Jane Austens might be more appropriate.  We have on our side the anxiety of the giant games companies are still not attracting half the population, girls, to buy their products. In this cause, Sega are threatening to animate comic-strip love stories to attract women.  If software in the eighties needed an injection of authorship then virtual reality in the nineties will be an even more voracious devouror of talent.  Millions of pounds will be wasted on compelling trivia if authors do not come forward.. \par \par There is hope. The authors of Comic Osmo have now produced a commercial adventure on CD ROM called Myst that has mystery and adventure. It is both intelligent and beautiful. Is it the beginning of quality of resources that are a genuine challenge to books?  I hope so: quality will be the result of competition. But we have to hang on in there.  Just think about the new resource we have for story telling. New authoring packages like HyperStudio}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\fs18\ul Hyperstudio }{\fs18 Software supplied by TAG, software developer and publisher 0474 357 350}}}{\f4  are also important because they encourage pupils to make their own multimedia adventures and explore other kinds of multi-level communication.  \par \par Authors and artists must have more confidence in their collaborative role.  When Phil, Wood the Scoop programmer, landed a programming job in industry at three times the salary, he took me out to lunch. We had had some really heated discussions at times about what Scoop and Newsnet ought to do, so I was particularly pleased that there seemed to be no hard feelings.  "Far from it," he said. "You insisted on achieving the educational aims and objectives of the programs in complete disregard of what I thought the computer would do.  You made me stretch and bend the rules. In fact, I was given this job because I had taken the BBC B further than anyone thought it could go - so thanks for the push!"\par \par This priority given to educational good practice above technical expediency was the most important philosophy I learnt  from the Educational Computing Unit at King's College, London University, which was directed by Dr. Margaret Cox. But we must adapt this philosophy for changing times.  Old software is still being sold because it was designed and sometimes programmed by teachers with education in mind. This software along with non-industrial standard software is giving newcomers a poor impression of what educational computing is all about.}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\f4 Harris and Preston  S}{\f4\ul oftware in schools}{\f4  - NFER/NCET 1993 From NFER, The Mere, Slough, Berks.}}}{\f4    Devtray, Scoop and Newsnet have had their day. \par \par So has 8-bit hardware. Beware the IT co-ordinator who send the BBCs or 186s down to the junior department when he takes delivery of PCs or Apple with a Windows style operating system.  Yes, I know, it seems to make seductive financial sense but....  Computers challenge the very notion of progression in the national curriculum. There are still schools where IT co-ordinators save the delights of Windows to Key Stage four so that pupils can progress to the best at the end of their school career.  This is a nonsensical approach to progression.  In my study for NFER and NCET}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\f4 Harris and Preston  }{\f4\ul Software in schools }{\f4 - NFER/NCET 1993 From NFER, The Mere, Slough, Berks.}}}{\f4  we found that in areas where primary and secondary schools were using Archimedes, Apples or PC Compatibles with Windows the quality and range of the work done at all levels was at the sharp end of computing. Infants and juniors were making multimedia books, for example. Because of the ease of the Windows style environment they were  publishing their work on integrated packages with the same panache as secondary pupils down the road.\par \par Most teachers' progression is rather behind that of their students.  In the Computers in the Curriculum department at King\rquote s College, I was seen as the below average teacher test-bed. "If she can use it so can a chimpanzee with a sock over its head" was the general view of my computer competence.  Richard Millward of Small Talk fame was especially patient with me. I called him in one day in the conviction that my computer had taken leave of its senses. I had been shouting at it for half an hour already because, since I had changed the position of the keyboard, the screen filled with gibberish every time I typed.  Richard summed up the problem as delicately as he could. "If women of your ample build" he explained, "lean too far over the keyboard, gobbledy-gook will result!"\par }{\b\f4 \par An Apple for the Teacher\par \par }{\f4 The main purpose of the software development collaboration between BT and the Computers in the Curriculum project at King\rquote s had been to train teachers to understand the implications of information technology }{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\f4  Peter Thompson }{\f4\ul BT Software for Education }{\f4 View September 1985 }}}{\f4  My own study}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\f4\ul C.

Ninety per cent of the teachers who had been designing and trialling the programs had gone on to use telematics extensively in the classroom.  Half the group had become telematics co-ordinators and advisory teachers.\par \par So what impetus heralded a quantum leap in my own computer competence and confidence? Two years seconded to King's College was a major factor,  but the single event that had the most influence was the decision to part with two and a half thousand pounds of our family budget to buy a 20K Apple computer.  The Apple SE was the thinking woman's computer - well designed, an intelligent interface, compact, it looked attractive in my Charles Rennie Mackintosh sitting room.  I have never regretted the decision: it was love at first sight. \par \par My dream is that we will have the foresight of the French who exchanged the cost of telephone books for a terminal in every home. The Open University now offers Apple Computers with modems to all its Post Graduate teachers. But still we do not offer tax advantages to teachers buying machines.  We have to lobby creatively on this issue.\par \par }{\b\f4 Industry and education partnership\par \par }{\f4 From the moment I accepted that invitation to design software in 1987, BT has been the most stable element of my life in teacher training.  From the secondment to King\rquote s I returned to Croydon as an advisory teacher, moved on to ILECC for two years and finally became the director of Project Miranda based at the Institute of Education where I work with over twenty five companies.  In all these roles, BT and I have continued in partnership.  In fact industry has been having a positive influence on the telematics curriculum in schools for some years.  My recent survey for NCET and NFER indicated that in schools where challenging information technology practice was evident across the curriculum, industrial partnership had made a significant contribution to their success.  BT was one of those companies.}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\f4\ul Software in schools -}{\f4  NFER/NCET Harris and Preston 1993 From NFER, The Mere, Slough, Berks.}}}{\f4 \par \par The BT Education Service(BTES) and I have built up a range of successful teacher training strategies over the last ten years. BT have encouraged experiment. For example,  we ran a series of national role play residential workshops.  I landed teachers on planets where pencils exploded.  Teachers with little experience of telematics had to set up a community, publishing their laws, producing their guidebook and attracting settlers from earth. Email colleagues from all over the world were in role messaging the planet newcomers.  The pressure of deadlines gave the teachers an impetus to learn.  They found that the computer was a valuable tool.  Other longer term training project include the training of teachers in the 129 schools in Schoolink partnership with BT. These schools use Campus 2000 as a means of communication.  One use is to transmit raw journalists\rquote  data for students to use in national newspaper days. The BT Education Service also makes use of the Understanding British Industry (UBI) teacher placement scheme as a training model. Last year this UBI team evaluated the BTES secondary school and post sixteen services.  They are now developing the use of teacher placement itself}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\f4  C.

Although I had designed for 8-bit machines, at Kings College I had not used them. I couldn't believe that primary school teachers were expected to get the hang of these illogical beasts.  A blinking cursor on a black screen is a threat I will never forget.  And when someone whispered that the code for formatting a disc on a 186 was  a: b:/s I suffered the same sense of incredulity as when a boy in the playground told me about the mechanics of sex.  "Why bother?," I thought,." I mean did you ever hear such an unlikely and inelegant waste of time?\par \par This was not the only shock I had.  Our daughter, who was sixteen, caught a virus which attacked her heart muscle. She had all the care that the national health and medical technology could give her including a new heart. But three months from the diagnosis she had died. \par \par I do not need to describe the pain. You can imagine I am sure. But you may like to consider the role of the computer in my life in those first two years.  When I could not sleep, when the pain was too much I would put my head into the computer. I could write or develop ideas with a total concentration that gave some relief from the suffering.  There is a danger, of course,  that inadequate people may find their sense of control in a computer game preferable to the life they lead. Why should they ever leave the friendly shores of the screen where they are in control?  We may need to answer that question.\par \par But this kind of concentration can be used for good as well as ill. Yes, the pornographic possibilities of virtual reality are worrying}{\cs16\super \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \f12\fs20\cgrid {\cs16\super \chftn }{\f4  Mark Sealey Educational Computing and Technology March 1994 }}}{\f4  but what about the terminally ill patient who can go to the theatre or walk through a sunny wood without leaving their bed? And what about the trainee surgeon who can practise on virtual patients instead of killing a few real ones on the way to perfection? We have to be alive to the potential of virtual reality and seize the chance....or else? \par \par In education we must learn to use these facilities as teaching and learning tools.

More informal and accessible video conferencing and the transmission of multimedia materials, simultaneous exchange of text, graphics and speech make  lecturing and collaborative work across any distance more effective. JANET, the joint academic network, is  being developed by BT to embrace the advantages of wider bandwidths in SuperJANET.  \par \par }{\b\f4 Special needs and computers\par \par }{\f4 The computer is a tool that is indispensable for the most disadvantaged.  Stephen Hawking, the great physicist,  could not write or speak without his system nor operate his 'smart house'.  Chris Nolan  won the Whitbread prize for his novel Under the Eye of the Clock.  Not a prize for fiction written by the severely disabled, but an international prize in which his word processed novel won on its own merits. \par \par My greatest insight into the enabling power of the computer was when I was running the Computer Assisted Reading project in Croydon Local Education Authority.  One reluctant reader maintained that there was a conspiracy by other pupils and teachers to pretend that the black squiggles on book pages meant something.  When we supplied a computer for her she wanted to tell a story.  A friend showed her how to key in the first word - THERE.\par \par She stared at it on the screen. \par \ldblquote Print it out please,\rdblquote  she said. \par I was busy.  \par "Shouldn't you write some more before we print?\rdblquote  I suggested.\par \ldblquote Print it out please,\rdblquote  she insisted.\par \par The girl went to her exercise book and pointed to an unintelligible squiggle.  The girl said, \ldblquote That \lquote There\rquote  printed is the same word as my written 'there\rquote , isn't it?\rdblquote  Her teacher described the look of revelation on the girl\rquote s face as the kind of expression that keeps a teacher going for another half term.  In fact, the sort of expression that blesses a teacher\rquote s vocation. \par \par The explanation for the girl\rquote s joy was her new understanding. Her handwriting was so uncontrolled that she had never been able to make the connection between printed book and exercise book before. Interacting with the keyboard made all the difference to her perception of words.  She became a normal reader. \par \par There are many good moments like this in using computers.
