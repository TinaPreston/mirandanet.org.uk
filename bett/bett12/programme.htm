    <h3>BETT12 11th &#8211; 14th January 2012, Olympia, London.</h3>
    <p>Achievement for All (<a href="http://www.afa3as.org.uk/">www.afa3as.org.uk</a>) 
      a tailored school improvement framework, delivered in partnership with leaders, 
      teachers, parents, pupils and support professionals, that aims to raise 
      the aspirations, access and achievement of pupils identified with SEND. 
      A two-year pilot has demonstrated unprecedented impact for SEND pupils, 
      who progressed faster on average than all pupils nationally in English and 
      Maths. Achievement for All schools may wish to apply the Achievement for 
      All framework to a wider range of vulnerable pupils in line with their whole-school 
      improvement strategy. </p>
    <p><a href="../../associates/afa3as.htm"><img src="../../associates/afa/AfA_Programme_Purple.gif" alt="Achievement for All" width="260" height="30"  style="float:right; padding: 5px" title="Achievement for All" /></a>Achievement 
      for All will be developing and sharing effective digital practices in raising 
      achievement within the target group through a series of Achievement for 
      All workshops to be held at the BETT exhibition in London, 11th &#8211; 
      14th January. Several professional organisations will contribute what is 
      already known in this area and debate what might be useful in the future. 
      The workshops are being delivered in partnership with the MirandaNet Fellowship 
      and students from the University of Bedfordshire. </p>
    <p>Achievement for All leads, coaches and champions, and other professionals 
      attending BETT interested in the aims of Achievement for All, will be invited 
      to reflect on what has been learnt from the successful Achievement for All 
      pilot project (2009-2011) and to draw on the range of expert presentations 
      to debate next steps. Resources will be developed in real time during these 
      workshops and outcomes used to disseminate strategies on how achievement 
      can be raised. All contributors will be eligible for a certificate for participation 
      in a professional development event and access to the resources collected 
      over the four days. </p>
    <p><a name="workshops" id="workshops"></a>There are two professional development 
      sessions each day (Wednesday to Friday) in the form of a live workshop starting 
      at 12:00 and 15:30 in <strong>Gallery Room 1, Grand Hall Gallery</strong>, 
      which is also open all day for networking. Two further live workshops on 
      Saturday will start at 11:00 and 14:00. Each session will last no more than

      technologies (Part One)</h3>
    <h4>Tools for improving effective learning for vulnerable learners</h4>
    <p><strong>Thursday 12th January. Starts at 12:00</strong></p>
    <p><em>Achievement for All</em> is a tailored school improvement framework, 
      delivered in partnership with leaders, teachers, parents, pupils and support 
      professionals, that aims to raise the aspirations, access and achievement 
      of pupils identified with SEND. Champions and coaches from <em>Achievement 
      for All</em> will be setting out the key themes of the framework. Participants 
      will explore what has been learnt about the value of digital technologies 
      for vulnerable learners in the first year and what questions need to be 
      answered as the framework grows. Themes will include diversifying styles 
      of teaching, exploring independent learning and harnessing the power of 
      learning technologies used in the home and in social exchanges.</p>
    <p>Session led by Professor Sonia Blandford, National Director, and CEO of 
      Achievement for All 3As, and Maggie Wagstaff, Achievement Coach, with Christine 
      Terrey, Executive Headteacher, Grays School, Newhaven and Southdown Junior

      technologies (Part Two)</h3>
    <h4>Parents, carers and the wider community supporting vulnerable learners</h4>
    <p><strong>Thursday 12th January. Starts at 15:30</strong></p>
    <p>Regional Leads and coaches from the <em>Achievement for All</em> project 
      will be setting out out the key themes that relate to the role that parents, 
      carers and the wider community can take in using social media and publication 
      opportunities to improve the learning chances of vulnerable young people.</p>
    <p>Participants will explore what has been learnt about the value of digital 
      technologies for vulnerable learners in the first year and what questions 
      need to be answered about building communities of learners as the project 
      grows. Themes will include: the importance of carers, parents and the wider 
      community, exploring independent learning and harnessing the power of learning 
      technologies used in the home and in social exchanges. The potential and 
      the challenges of social networking will be a major consideration.</p>
    <p>Session introduced by Professor Sonia Blandford and led by Karen Thomas, 
      Achievement for All Regional Lead, with Christine Terrey, Executive Headteacher, 
      Grays School, Newhaven and Southdown Junior School, Newhaven.</p>
    <h3><a name="lw5" id="lw5"></a>Empowering students to harness the power of 
      social networking for learning</h3>
    <h4>Using the social media to enhance learning communities for teachers and 
      students</h4>
    <p><strong>Friday 13th January. Starts at 12:00</strong></p>
    <p>Being part of a virtual community can be a powerful means of learning if 
      the participants know how to use these powerful social media wisely, safely 
      and for positive learning outcomes. In this unconference leading practitioners 
      and theoreticians will be debating the value and the dangers of social networking 
      in learning contexts at home and in school with parents, carers, champions 
      and coaches from the <em>Achievement for All</em> programme. The participants 
      will look at current practice and future developments to anticipate how 
      social networking might be used to support vulnerable learners and their 
      teachers, and what checks and balances need to be put in place to harness 
      the power of these new media. There will be a focus on case studies where 
      social networking has already increased learning opportunities for teachers 
      and students. </p>
    <p>Invited experts introducing the theme will include: Professors Marilyn 
      Leask and Christina Preston, Bedfordshire University; Eeva Leinonen, Kings 
      College, University of London; Dr John Cuthell, Terry Freedman, Leon Cych

    <h4>Raising the achievement of pupils who are not reaching their full learning 
      potential: a senior manager perspective</h4>
    <p><strong>Friday 13th January. Starts at 15:30</strong></p>
    <p>Chris Yapp, who is researching a book on Pervasive Learning, will chair 
      this live workshop which is about how the ideals of Achievement for All 
      can be promoted by the right policies and strategies. He will be supported 
      by international experts from professional organisations and companies who 
      have been collaborating on policy reports in 2011. </p>
    <p><strong>EDUSummit IT report</strong> (UNESCO Paris, 2011) ) written by 
      world educators who are looking at ways in which vulnerable learners can 
      be supported by digital technologies in a range of global contexts: rural 
      and urban; privileged and underprivileged; learners who are challenged and 
      those who are gifted and talented. A key element of this report is the need 
      for better deployment strategies by senior managers in ensuing that digital 
      technologies can be exploited in school. Experts introducing the themes 
      will be Dr Christina Preston, Professor of Educational Innovation, Bedfordshire 
      University; Professors Margaret Cox and Eeva Leinonen, Dr Mary Webb, Kings 
      College, University of London.</p>

    <p><strong>The changing landscape: after Becta</strong> (Warwick 2011) Members 
      of ITTE, Naace and other experts in ICT collaborated at Warwick University 
      in July to review the the role of Becta and predecessor agencies before 
      the coalition government was elected and to look ahead to a &#8216;changing 
      landscape&#8217;. In terms of Achievement for All the report stresses the 
      importance of ICT to engagement and motivation particularly its contribution 
      for those who find the existing curriculum difficult to access. In this 
      debate, Micheal Hammond, Sarah Younie and other members of this group will 
      present their thinking about the future research agenda including personalising 
      learning; the value of the competent learner; parental engagement; understanding 
      individual difference; and risk taking online.</p>

    <p>Research shows that learning improves when self esteem is high. In this 
      context, engaging with other children around the world is known to promote 
      a strong sense of identity and personal value. World Ecitizens teacher members 
      will therefore be discussing the value of their curriculum exchange projects 
      between schools with MirandaNet Fellows and colleagues from countries including 
      the Czech Republic, India, Germany, France and Australia. The aim is to

    <h4><a name="unconference" id="unconference"></a>More about Live Workshops</h4>
    <p>These live workshops, also called <a href="../../mirandamods/index.html">MirandaMods</a>, 
      are participant-driven events that equally involve all the educators, parents 
      and carers who attend, not just the main speakers. The outputs of these 
      sessions will be used to create a web-based Professional Knowledge Hub to 
      be interrogated and added to throughout the life of the <em>Achievement 
      for All</em> programme.</p>
    <p>Invited experts and organisations will briefly explain the specific Achievement 
      for All related themes for the session from their own perspective. Each 
      contributor will speak for between 2 to 5 minutes outlining their key points. 
      Presentation software is not encouraged in order to promote engagement with 
      the audience, but accompanying resources will be allocated space in the 
      Professional Knowledge Hub so that more detail can be stored.</p>
    <p>Each session will be opened by <em>Achievement for All</em> leads, coaches 
      and champions who will explain the programme&#8217;s aims and achievements 
      so far. MirandaNet Fellows will explain the principles of a live workshop 
      and, in particular, how all participants can enter their thoughts and comments 
      into a collaborative Knowledge Hub as the debate progresses.</p>
