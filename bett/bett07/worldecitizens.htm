    <h3>The World Ecitizens Charity &#8211; Giving young people a voice</h3>
  <p>The advent of the internet offers opportunities for innovative approaches 
    to continuing professional development (CPD. The MirandaNet Fellowship is 
    an internet-mediated community of practice in education, which has been experimenting 
    with the potential of new technology to support participative models of CPD 
    since 1992. MirandaNet&#8217;s practice is shown to exemplify a model of CPD 
    as induction into an internet-based community of practice in education. The 
    inclusion of representatives of industry, academia and policy makers in the 
    community is shown to facilitate the integration of practice-based research 
    with real transformation in the material and social conditions of teachers 
    and children. </p>
  <p> This interest in the social environment and the community of the schools 
    resulted in a positive response to the 9/11 in New York. Members raised the 
    funding to set up the charity, World Ecitizens, which offers free the use 
    of a Virtual Learning Environment and Gallery. The objectives of the charity 
    are to ensure that young learners have a voice on public affairs (www.worldecitizens.net). 
    The hope is that the surge of violence between ethnic groups in the playground 
    which concerned member after 9/11 would be calmed through working across cultures 
    within and between schools. Shared projects are seen as a means of shared 
    understanding and tolerance. </p>
  <p> Learners can become World Ecitizens by publishing on this site. Because 
    there is evidence that the Internet can facilitate those with evil intentions, 
    it seemed important to the ecommunity to provide the conditions where the 
    use of educational technology would also be a powerful source for good. </p>
  <p><strong>Christina Preston, Chair of MirandaNet and World Ecitizens<br>
    <em>(Interview with George Cole, TES)</em></strong></p>
  <p>Christina Preston, the chair of MirandaNet, is also the Chair of Trustees 
    of World Ecitizens. She argues that ICT should be used much more for giving 
    young people a voice and breaking down cultural barriers.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="block">&#8220;It&#8217;s a fallacy to think that children are not 
      interested in politics or are unaffected by major world events. I can remember 
      as a child cowering under the table when the 1962 Cuban missile crisis appeared 
      on my parents&#8217; television screen. War, conflict, poverty, homelessness 
      and the environment are just some issues that are important to many children, 
      even those living in comfortable Western societies. You don&#8217;t need 
      me to tell you that we are living through a turbulent period. September 
      11th, the Afghan War and the conflict in Iraq have all made the world seem 
      a less safe place, so what impact must these be having on children, as they 
      are bombarded with images on their TV screens and on the front of newspapers? 
      Children do not go around this world with their eyes and ears closed. They 
      know a lot more about what is going on than we often give them credit for. 
      What is true is they often find it difficult to articulate their thoughts 
      and feelings, especially on a face-to-face basis with an adult. </p>
    <p class="block"> What is also true is that despite living in an information 
      age of 24-hour news programmes, the internet and teletext, there is still 
      a lot of ignorance about other people&#8217;s cultures and there is a lack 
      of understanding on how others live. Let me give you an example. I have 
      just returned from Syria and I was very much taken by the fact that there 
      are women with very good jobs and that it&#8217;s a secular state. Now, 
      Syria is also a presidential dictatorship, which I don&#8217;t support, 
      but I was still a surprised to find how tolerant the Syrians were when it 
      came to women&#8217;s rights and religious freedom. </p>
    <p class="block"> Teachers are reporting increased tension both in the classroom 
      and the playground as a result of the current conflicts. There has been 
      a rise in religious intolerance. There has been an increase in bullying. 
      There has been a growth of racism. It&#8217;s a truism that much of the 
      mistrust in our world is due to ignorance and lack of understanding. It&#8217;s 
      a failure to listen to someone else&#8217;s point of view and to learn more 
      about their situation. That&#8217;s why I believe ICT can be a force for 
      good, because it makes it easier to communicate with others across both 
      time and distance.</p>
    <p class="block"> At present, a lot of ICT tends to be focused on the established 
      curriculum but I&#8217;m really interested in the new subject, citizenship, 
      and using ICT to develop our creative and thinking skills Fortunately, I 
      believe the pendulum is swinging back and there&#8217;s a realisation that 
      we need to do more in the area of citizenship.</p>
    <p class="block"> Of course, a number of schools have already forged links 
      with overseas institutions and that&#8217;s a good thing. But I&#8217;m 
      more interested in people talking to each other and discovering more about 
      each other rather than simply working together on curriculum-based projects. 
      That is why MirandaNet has established the World Ecitizens Fellowship. World 
      Ecitizens is a non-profit making organisation that aims to promote understanding 
      of other cultures and customs, especially amongst younger people. We now 
      have 25 WE chapters in places such as Africa, Australia, Bulgaria, Chile, 
      China, Japan, the USA as well as the UK.</p>
    <p class="block"> The projects involve communities working together towards 
      conflict resolution. Collaborations focus on joint activities like developing 
      creativity, communication life and thinking skills. To support these projects 
      MirandaNet Fellows have developed a web based learning environment. This 
      website provides a place where World Ecitizens can join together to envision 
      a sense of a shared future; create a sense of shared history; and capture 
      and share learning experiences. It is a safe learning space, which we see 
      as a rich and exciting resource for community exchange and international 
      understanding. </p>
    <p class="block"> Since the WE environment was set-up, communities and classes 
      of young people have produced posters, video clips and comic strips about 
      citizenship issues of their choice such as homelessness and international 
      citizenship. Some young people have worked with artists and writers in residence. 
      In one project exploring homelessness, children from East London produced 
      a graphic novel and a video highlighting the issues they had researched. 
      The publishers of 2000AD worked with schools and homeless charities. Two 
      freelance cartoonists were involved and film makers from Kushti Moving Image. 
      These young artists were keen to lend their skills to help the children 
      communicate effectively, and they were impressed by the childrens&#8217; 
      professional approach. The George Mitchell School in London examined a variety 
      of citizenship themes such as social exclusion and immigration. Holy Cross 
      Convent School in Kingston upon Thames has established collaborative Internet 
      and video conferencing links with the Ikeda Junior High School in Osaka, 
      Japan, allowing them to share each other&#8217;s culture through sound and 
      video.</p>
    <p class="block"> The World Ecitizens (WE) website started with UnITy, a project 
      supported by Domex and the DFES in which UK teachers and students collaborated 
      within schools, across the wider community and internationally to begin 
      building knowledge base and communication hub with children from the UK, 
      Portugal, Ireland, Bangladesh and China. In these projects children are 
      getting the opportunity to think about how the world can be made a better 
      place. </p>
    <p class="block"> It&#8217;s ironic that in today&#8217;s so-called global 
      village, the world seems more divided than ever. With ICT we have the opportunity 
      to bridge this divide; to help bring young people together to share cultures, 
      ideas, thoughts and feelings. If we can help spread the message that all 
      of us are citizens of the same planet and that we all share a common humanity, 
      then many of the barriers that divide us can be broken down. What could 
      be a better use for ICT than this?&#8221;</p>
