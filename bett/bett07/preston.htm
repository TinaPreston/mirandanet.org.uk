<h3>The new World Ecitizens Charity &#8211; Giving young people a voice</h3>
  <p><strong>Christina Preston, Chair of MirandaNet and World Ecitizens </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Professional Profile</strong></p>
  <p>Christina Preston, the Founder and Chair of the MirandaNet Fellowship, advocates 
    the application of new media as a catalyst for change in teaching and learning. 
    Recent research and development projects focus on innovative models for ICT 
    Continuing Professional Development and practice: the building of international 
    web-based communities of practice: supporting teachers as peer ementors and 
    international exchanges in citizenship and ICT leadership. Practice based 
    research is the preferred methodology for teacher education (mirandanet.ac.uk).</p>
  <p> The MirandaNet Fellowship was established in 1992 in response to a need 
    expressed amongst teachers for a supportive community of peers who would mentor 
    each other in the exploration of new media potential (www.mirandanet.ac.uk). 
    The vision, which is revisited by the members each year is: </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="block"> The Fellowship spans national, social, cultural, commercial 
      and political divides. Together scholars and fellows create an inclusive 
      forum for the development of teaching practice, the building of an classroom 
      evidence knowledge base, the dissemination of innovative programmes for 
      professional learning by sharing emergent trends in the use of new media 
      and technology in education. Peer mentoring and practice based research 
      strategies celebrate individual learning patterns and varied experience. 
      Dissemination and publication are central to the Fellowship learning process. 
      Partnership with the education industry and policy makers is at the heart 
      of MirandaNet activities.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The MirandaNet web site is a lively presence on the Internet with an average 
    daily rate of 1,500 page requests. There are now about two hundred Fellows 
    in twenty-five Chapters all over the world and about 300 scholars. Scholars 
    become Fellows when they publish a case study about their ICT work. </p>
  <p> The MirandaNet Fellowship has initiated three recent ventures. The first, 
    World Ecitizens (WE), is a website for children&#8217;s publications - a response 
    to global upheavals caused by the War on Terror. This website aims to encourage 
    understanding between peoples, cultures and communities and to share across 
    the world the fascinating diversity within nations ( www.worldecitizens.net).</p>
  <p> A second venture is a MirandaNet e-journal written by teachers for teachers 
    The MirandaNet e-journal pilot was designed to provide teachers practising 
    teachers with a professional platform where they can publish their evidence 
    and create a knowledge base This e-journal which will be peer reviewed has 
    been popular with teachers on practice-based courses and raised the standards 
    of course work.</p>
  <p> The third venture is the MirandaNet International Research Centre at Southhampton 
    University directed by Rupert Wegerif. One project is about transformational 
    learning and attainment linked to computers in schools funded by <a href="../../associates/interactive.htm">Promethean</a>. 
    The plan is to include Mexico in the second research and development stage 
    of this project which looks at the uses of interactive whiteboards in China, 
    UK and South Africa. </p>
  <p> Christina Preston holds honorary associateships at the Institute of Education, 
    University of London, and the Czech Technical University, Prague. Professional 
    memberships include the British Computer Society, the Society of Authors, 
    the National Association of Advisers in Computers and Education (NAACE) and 
    Information Technology Teachers in Education (ITTE). She is also on the judging 
    panel of BETT and the British Computer Society education awards as well as 
    being a referee on the panel of the Technology, Pedagogy and Education journal 
    published byTriangle and the CAL conference proceedings published by Elsevier. 
    She is also Chair of the World Ecitizens organization which has applied for 
    charity status, a Trustee of Tools for Schools and an advisor to the Machizo 
    organization for unity in Bangladesh.</p>
  <p> Her awards include the Trnkova Medal from the Czech Technical University 
    Prague for support in building democratic strategies for ICT teacher education 
    (2002 - Prague) A humanitarian Award from the World Academic Council for the 
    enrichment of community opportunities for Bulgarian teachers and women returnees 
    by creating Anglo-Bulgarian exchange opportunities face-to-face and online 
    (2000 - Paris) The European Union of Women Humanitarian Achievement Award 
    for creating an Anglo-Czech online alliance working on democratic participation 
    (1998 - London)</p>
  <p> Christina Preston is also managing director of MirandaNet Ltd, an international 
    education and ICT consultancy services, which includes practising teachers.

    the DfES, the EU, as well as international universities. Partner companies
