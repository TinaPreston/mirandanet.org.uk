    <h3>A MirandaNet Fellowship case study</h3>
  <h3>Building international communities of teachers online: Promethean Ambassadors 
    for ACTIVlearning.</h3>
  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
  <p>The MirandaNet Fellowship has been using new technologies to support participative 
    models of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) within a moral, social 
    and aesthetic framework since 1992 (www.mirandanet.ac.uk). Fellows have been 
    engaged in several ICT research projects for BECTA, DfES and TTA as well as 
    developing the use of ICTs in continents and countries as diverse as China, 
    Eastern European, Latin America and South Africa. Over the years Fellows have 
    developed a series of strategies, which can be helpful in particularly in 
    countries where computers are just being introduced. The mix of professionals 
    in the organisation is noteworthy: teachers, teacher educators, researchers, 
    policy makers and company partners. The reason why companies like Aston Swann, 
    Oracle, Microsoft, Inspiration and Toshiba a like to partner MirandaNet Fellows 
    is their critical engagement with the issues as well as the evidence of effective 
    practice. The professional organisation has developed innovative approaches 
    to CPD in the new media thus meeting the learning needs of local, regional 
    and global communities. Case studies which can be seen on the website highlight 
    a wide range of issues in digital education from the emergence of learning 
    communities to opportunities for boosting the local economy for indigenous 
    people. The companies involved find this a good method of using research and 
    development funds not only to improve their products but also to raise the 
    awareness and competence of the teaching profession </p>
  <p>Since 2003 one of the MirandaNet research and development project has been 
    in partnership with the Promethean on the effective use of interactive whiteboards, 
    or ACTIVboards, in raising attainment and transforming teaching and learning.</p>
  <p><strong>Case study</strong><br>
    The Promethean ACTIVlearning Ambassadors team is one illustration of the collaborative 
    learning of teachers across four nations; China, Mexico, South Africa and 
    the UK. The research is focusing on the use of ACTIVboards in raising attainment 
    and transforming learning across four universities and 30 schools. 24 teachers 
    are also developing detailed action research studies of good practice to share 
    with other suers on the Promethean World website. At the centre of this action 
    research is the belief in finding ways of releasing the creative power of 
    professional teachers.</p>
  <p> The MirandaNet Fellowship were the natural choice of partner for Promethean 
    as took up the use of ACTIVboards as soon as they appeared in the market. 
    As early as 1999 MirandaNet Fellows identified the interactive white board 
    (IWB) or ACTIVboard as a tool that had the potential to transform teaching 
    and learning before they were widely used in the UK. From 2000 &#8211; 2003 
    an early case study about ACTIVboard on the MirandaNet site was at the top 
    of the hit list and download list because there was so little on the subject. 
    Despite the lack of available evidence in the early noughties, the UK government 
    has made a considerable investment in ACTIVboard through the National Grid 
    for Learning and through targeted national government funds known as &#8220;Standards 
    Funds&#8221;. The literature in the UK which has now grown exponentially indicates 
    that there appears to be a progression from descriptions of perceived gains 
    in presentation and motivation when ACTIVboard are first purchased to a growing 
    concentration on the pedagogy involved and the potential for resourcing the 
    learners&#8217; need for diversity of teaching and learning styles. Many of 
    the short term studies that have been developed so far have concluded with 
    simplistic lists of the advantages and disadvantages of using boards. Better 
    studies have concentrated on different forms of practice and made suggestions 
    about training. From the start MirandaNet have been interested in the wider 
    picture of digital tools that can help to raise teachers&#8217; self esteem, 
    lower the stress levels in innovative activity,improve attainment and provide 
    a means of transforming the school learning environment. Emerging findings 
    suggest that the ACTIVboard is such a tool. </p>
  <p>This kind of approach to teachers as masters of creativity emerged from the 
    Promethean/ MirandaNet pilot project conducted with twelve UK Fellow in 2003/2004 
    and is a major area of investigation in the new stage of the research from 
    2005 - 2008. This final illustration of the way in which the MirandaNet model 
    operates relates to a community called Promethean World, which is being facilitated 
    by MirandaNet Fellows between teachers in the UK, Mexico, China and South 
    Africa. The reason for the choice of nations is that the policy makers are 
    all committed to the transformation of traditional classroom teaching and 
    examination reform. They see the ACTIVboard as a powerful catalyst for change. 
    The MirandaNet partners are Promethean UK, manufacturers of the ACTIVboard. 
    The company started as a hardware manufacturer, but has proven to be as far-sighted 
    as Toshiba was ten years before. The Promethean staff see learning as a totality 
    of experience and specialise in providing a full learning suite of award winning 
    software and in-depth training. Experience has alerted the company to the 
    fact that some purchasers are disillusioned with their purchase of IWB because 
    they do not provide adequate training. As a result teachers use the boards 
    as expensive blackboards, if they use them at all. Promethean are now funding 
    a three-year international practice-based research project to evaluate the 
    impact of their ACTIVboards on traditional attainment as well as the transformation 
    of teaching and learning so that the software and the training can be further 
    strengthened. </p>
  <p> Since the start of the pilot in 2002 the project has been documented on 
    the MirandaNorth site. Detailed analysis has also been published of the impact 
    of the project on pedagogy, praxis and learning. This UK study has developed 
    the &#8216;missioners&#8217; in schools who Glover, Miller define as the teacher 
    who not only understands the technology but who also sees the ability to see 
    how this could be used to advantage and often develops software to demonstrate 
    the pedagogical advantages. MirandaNet is a self-selected group of missioners 
    who have achieved the necessary critical mass to make advance as a group possible. 
    However, this kind of external community support can be vital to teachers 
    who do not find this critical mass in their schools. Three of the five schools 
    in this project in 2003 have provided mentor Fellows who are able to support 
    other teachers in learning &#8216;how to do it&#8217; through visits and seminars. 
    Castle View in Sunderland, has ACTIVboards in every department, support for 
    the whole staff in training and, despite the local challenges, a vision for 
    transformation, which embraces the principles of the management of change. 
    This is a good example of a school where there are enough missioners to make 
    a difference. Here the missioners are supported by the Continuing Professional 
    Development plan in ICT for the whole school team which includes assistants, 
    supplies and support staff. The head teacher started as a MirandaNet Toshiba 
    scholar in 1994 and has written a paper about the support this membership 
    has given him in the building of his thinking as he has moved from a classroom 
    teacher to a head. This head teacher&#8216;s progress through the MirandaNet 
    community is an important illustration of the way in which active scholars 
    achieve fellowship and then prove themselves as lead learners and mentors 
    in the fellow system of awards. Educators like David graduate to run their 
    own local version of a MirandaNet chapter, which takes on the relevant community 
    features in the context of a school or a regional or local group. The Missioners 
    who stand out from the Tentatives and Luddites in schools in the Glover and 
    Miller&#8217;s study of leadership and change will probably need communities 
    like MirandaNet in order to maintain their cutting edge and vision.</p>
  <p> In the next stage of the Ambassadors for ACTIVlearning research from 2005 
    to 2008, the researchers from Monterrey, Pretoria and Southampton Universities 
    and the Beijing Academy of Education Sciences are co-operating in collecting 
    data about the impact on traditional attainment scores as well as on the transformation 
    of teaching and learning. One strand of this research this will be to see 
    whether the use of ACTIVboards facilitates a change from transmissional to 
    more constructivist pedagogy. This raises interesting issues as in the countries 
    where the study is taking place the influence of testing and formal examinations 
    encourages transmissional pedagogy rather than constructivist pedagogy, even 
    though this conflicts with the policy rhetoric that often recommends new approach. 
  </p>
  <p> A range of educational institutions is involved in the four countries from 
    further education colleges to primary schools and early learning classrooms. 
    The project spans the public and private sectors and each of the countries 
    involved has been encouraged to take a different local slant on the use of 
    ACTIVboards to ensure that Promethean World users have a diverse range of 
    example to draw on. </p>
  <p> In the practice based research element of the study, three MirandaNet Fellows 
    from the original 2004 team who are now experienced practitioners are mentoring 
    teachers from schools in Beijing and Shandong in China, Johannesburg in South 
    Africa and Monterrey in Mexico. An online cross-cultural dialogue is already 
    being built up between residential workshops. This collaborative discourse 
    is planned to support all the participants, whether they be teachers, pupils, 
    students or administrative staff. </p>
  <p> International face-to-face meetings are supported by online dialogue and 
    knowledge construction in the Promethean Ambassadors ejournal that also acts 
    as a resource repository and an agent for distributed cognition. This cross-cultural 
    dialogue is building a collaborative discourse to support all the participants, 
    whether they be teachers, pupils, students or administrative staff. This community 
    is open to any educators with ACTIVboards and is a source of resource development 
    and sharing by teachers for teachers. This will add to the substantial resources, 
    which have already been provided by the company in partnership with practising 
    teachers. These resources are also used in the training programme offered 
    to buyers by Promethean, which includes skills training as well as learning 
    support.</p>
  <p> The twenty Promethean Ambassadors are classroom teachers who are being supported 
    by MirandaNet Mentors to be practice-based researchers who will feed back 
    results in to their schools. In the next stage, some of them will also include 
    the pupils as researchers as well. The teachers have been asked to identify 
    a challenge in the classroom, which the use of the ACTIVboard might address. 
    Figure Seven shows the range of challenges, which the different institutions 
    have identified. The similarities are possibly more surprising than the differences. 
  </p>
  <p> Inspiration, concept map software developers are additional partners who 
    have provided a new approach to collaborative thinking within the group. The 
    software was used by Wegerif, the director of the MirandaNet International 
    Research Centre at Southampton University to stimulate productive communication 
    between the different national groups in the second residential workshop in 
    Cape Town. This opportunity to record group thinking in a medium where the 
    full picture could be grasped on a screen captured the imagination of all 
    the teachers who choose, after this initial introduction, to use Inspiration 
    for all their planning and to share these maps as a means of grounding discussions 
    for the rest of the workshop. The range of projects reflects the freedom the 
    teachers have been given to research what interests them. </p>
  <p> The Chinese teachers are using the ACTIVboard in a series of complementary 
    contexts: two in Beijing and one in Shandong. At the Beijing Academy of Educational 
    Sciences (BAES) the research focus is on transforming teaching, learning and 
    attainment in primary schools. </p>
  <p> Shandong Agricultural University has also chosen to focus on the affordances 
    of ACTIVboards for English language teaching and learning. The use of multimedia 
    with flip charts is seen as a powerful language-teaching tool, with the ability 
    to freeze-frame the video and then annotate the frame. Writing frameworks 
    will also be developed in the flip charts to develop student performance. 
    Students will then progress to the creation of flip charts and resources to 
    support colleagues and pupils in Mexico through collaborative projects on 
    the theme of Citizenship. The South African teachers have also picked up this 
    theme in their outreach activities into schools in more disadvantaged areas 
    although security is a challenge yet to be solved. These schools are concentrating 
    on the use of the board in teaching literacy, numeracy as well as new media 
    literacy, which uses the multimodal and multimedia affordances of the board. 
    Using new media to make learning more active and to make students more independent 
    in China and Mexico has also meant moving the furniture so that classes of 
    60 are not sitting in formal rows but in groups. </p>
  <p> In the Monterrey region of Mexico, UNESCO are involved in the Promethean 
    ACTIVboard research where teachers have identified strategies to combat the 
    challenges that they face. In their projects these state schoolteachers already 
    have evidence that the boards can help to: </p>
  <ul class="block">
    <li> motivate reluctant learners</li>
    <li> create more active learning opportunities</li>
    <li> improve the design of resources</li>
    <li> use learners for resource development</li>
    <li> improve standards of literacy</li>
    <li> improve citizenship responsibility</li>
    <li> make the layout of classrooms more conducive to active learning</li>
    <li> extend the multimedia use of Enciclomedia curriculum resources</li>
    <li> enrich the ICT skills of educators and learners</li>
    <li> develop relevant resources</li>
    <li> facilitate the sharing of knowledge process amongst the school staff</li>
    <li> increase the involvement of parents and the local community</li>
    <li> increase democratic participation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition, there is evidence that the role of teachers acting as researchers 
    of their own practice has produced:</p>
  <ul class="block">
    <li> A transformation in their identities as practitioners towards a more 
      socially recognized role of compromised agents of change in education</li>
    <li>An empowerment in the decision making process for planning of lessons 
      and management within their schools and the State Secretary of Education</li>
    <li>More creativity in the design of educational resources and pedagogical 
      activities in their classrooms</li>
  </ul>
    <p> In the MirandaNet tradition the Promethean World Ambassadors are also working 
      on the development of a global online community of teachers who will share 
      experiences of using new technologies between the UK, China, South Africa 
      and Mexico. Currently the face-to-face workshops are an essential element 
      in getting to know and trust each other. However, over three years the plan 
      is that they will be able to mentor new ACTIVboard users and support software 
      developers in creating exciting new materials. Ultimately the children themselves 
      will be publishing for each other in the Promethean World website. </p>
