    <p><strong>Welcome to MirandaNet at BETT11, 12th &#8211; 15th January 2011</strong></p>
    <p>Come to the MirandaNet stand  S97 in its usual place on the first
      floor in the Grand Hall Gallery, Olympia, London. </p>
	<p style="clear:right"><img src="../../images/associates_logos/Uni_Bed_logo.jpg" alt="University of Bedfordshire" width="300" height="117" style="float:right; padding: 5px" title="University of Bedfordshire" />MirandaNet
	  are very pleased to announce that students from the <strong>University of
	  Bedfordshire</strong>	  are  supporting us on the stand this year as part
	  of their Events Management work experience.</p>
	<p><strong>Dr Nazia Ali</strong>, Lecturer in Tourism and Events Management &amp; BA (Hons) Events
  Management Course Leader, University of Bedfordshire:</p>
	<blockquote>I am absolutely delighted that the final year <strong>BA (Hons)
	    Events Management students</strong> are participating in the BETT11 conference. The work experience
	  provided by MirandaNet will definitely be of use in developing course participants'
	  employability skills to work in the events sector. The work experience
	  is
	  closely aligned with the learning outcomes of the unit <em>Issues in Event
	  Management</em>. For students to experience on-site event operations at the
	  BETT11 event both
	  reinforces lecture themes and prepares the students for their own event
  planning assessment task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </blockquote>

    <p>My name is Amira Mohamoud and I am currently studying Events Management
      at the University of Bedfordshire. I have worked for two years as a retail
      assistant in Emirates and Wembley Stadium, where I developed my customer
      service skills as well as my communication skills. My work was based on
      team work and effective communication amongst all staff members, to provide
      the best service to our customers. I have also learnt sales targets, and
      worked under pressure as I worked in a busy environment. I would describe
      myself as a focused and outgoing person, who enjoys experiencing new things
      as well as socialising and interacting with others. I am also interested
      in different type of events as I have been involved in charity events and
    college events.</p>
    <p style="clear:right"><img src="timothy.jpg" alt="Timothy Cakebread" width="200" height="200" style="float:right; padding: 5px" title="Timothy Cakebread" /><strong>Timothy Cakebread</strong></p>
    <p>My
      name is Timothy J Cakebread, and I have been involved with the Luton International
      Carnival since I was 6. I have been working in retail for
      the past two years, which has given me valuable insight into consumer care.
      My first job was at Goldsmiths Jewellers where I provided the full service
      experience. Secondly Tie Rack, where I  learnt more about admin skills,
      such as delegation of tasks. My current study course is Events Management,
    which will hopefully boost me into a career in Corporate Events Management.</p>
    <p> I am a keen lively person who enjoys communicating and interacting with
        people of all walks of life. Lastly I have had a keen interest in many
        types of events for many years now, and enjoy raising money for charity,
        and have also been in a variety of choirs. </p>
    <p style="clear:right"><img src="alison.jpg" alt="Alison Pengelly" width="200" height="200" style="float:right; padding: 5px" title="Alison Pengelly" /><strong>Alison Pengelly</strong></p>
    <p>Alison
      Pengelly joined the university as a mature student on the second year of
      the Event Management course after feeling that she had reached
      her full potential with her last employer. She also wished to pursue a
      career that was more aligned with her personal interests and would therefore
      offer her greater fullfilment and job satisfaction. With over 20 years
      experience as an employee in both the public and private sectors, Alison
      started her working life as a hairdresser before working for a local government
      organisation; within the customer services and marketing departments of
      a telecommunications company; foraying into the world of company secretarial
      and then finally retuning to marketing/customer services where she spent
    her last eight employed years as a manager.</p>
    <p> Alison's ambition is to gain additional experience within the Event's 
      industry before hopefully setting up her own practice. </p>

      Nicole Vettese</strong></p>
    <p> I am a University student of Bedfordshire University, studying Event Management, 
      and Ii am currently in my third year. I am very enthusiastic in organising 
      and participating within all aspects of events, especially weddings and 
      glamorous London events. This year I am researching for my dissertation, 
      whether or not there is still a demand for wedding planners, due to people 
      organising their own weddings, and the amount of information now available 
      on the internet. I am very excited about commencing the research for this, 
      to find out the results. I have had previous experience in events helping 
      out with local fundraisers and organising several parties. This year at 
      University Ii am organising a theatre production, where all money raised 
      will go to charity, as well as hosting a 24 hour football match, also for 
      charity. I am looking forward to staging both of these events as they should 
      be very enjoyable and fulfilling.</p>
    <p style="clear:right"><img src="birgul.jpg" alt="Birgul Yuksel" width="200" height="200" style="float:right; padding: 5px" title="Birgul Yuksel" /><strong>Birgul Yuksel</strong></p>
    <p>My name is Birgul Yuksel. I am a third year undergraduate
      student, studying BA Event Management at the University of Bedfordshire.
      I am currently working for Organic Surge which is a skin care company.
      My job has given me the experience of how marketing industry works as my
      job requires me to introduce the new range to customers who are not aware
      of the product. Working for Organic Surge has gained me more confidence.
      I have also learnt sales targets as my job requires me to sell over 10
      Organic Surge products. As Boots is a busy environment I have also learnt
      how to
      communicate with customers as well as with all the Boots staff members.
      Also for one of my units I am hosting a fashion show event with my group
    members to raise money for a charity called Headway.</p>
    <p>I am focused and a quick learner. Working as part of a team is one of
      my strongest points. Nevertheless, I am highly capable at working independently.
      Being customer focused and providing excellent customer service is always
      at the top of my priority list. My punctuality and attendance records have
      always been excellent. In a nutshell, I would describe myself as a focused,
      determined, out-going, funny person who always thrives at any given task.    </p>
    <p style="clear:right"><img src="nadia.jpg" alt="Nadia Khan" width="200" height="200" style="float:right; padding: 5px" title="Nadia Khan" /><strong>Nadia
          Khan</strong></p>
    <p>My
      name is Nadia Khan and I am a third year student studying events management
      at the University of Bedfordshire, situated at the Luton campus. I am currently
      working part time for a market research company as well as working for
      the university as a student ambassador. I am also organising a theatre
    production to raise money for a charity with a few fellow students. </p>
    <p>I am
        a very enthusiastic person and put 100% in everything I do. I feel one
        of my main strengths is that I am very well organised: for example with
      university work I will keep every thing in order and in separate folders. </p>
