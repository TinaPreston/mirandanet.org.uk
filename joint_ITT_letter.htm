    <h1>The training of teachers of Computer Science and ICT</h1>
    <p>Text of joint letter from <strong>ITTE</strong>, <strong>Naace</strong> 
      and <strong>MirandaNet</strong> to Mr Michael Gove, Secretary of State for 
      Education, on Friday 19th October 2012, expressing concerns about the removal 
      of ICT Teacher Training courses.</p>
    <p>Dear Mr Gove,</p>
    <p> <strong>RE: The training of teachers of Computer Science and ICT</strong></p>
    <p> In the light of recent announcements, we are writing on behalf of the 
      membership of the three professional bodies above, to raise some concerns 
      and offer some constructive solutions to improve the training of new teachers 
      of ICT/Computer Science.</p>
    <p><strong>The Association for IT in Teacher Education</strong> (ITTE) is 
      the professional association for IT/CS/Computing teacher training across 
      the UK. Its members are involved in initial teacher training of primary 
      teachers, subject specialist ICT and computer science teachers in secondary 
      and post-16 schools and colleges, Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) across 
      all subjects and research into ICT/Computer Science/TEL pedagogy</p>
    <p><strong>Naace</strong> is the professional membership association for those 
      enthusiastic for the role that appropriate use of technology can have in 
      advancing education and improving outcomes for young people. Naace is broadly 
      recognised as the ICT Subject Association by teachers and schools.</p>
    <p><strong>The MirandaNet Fellowship</strong> is an international professional 
      organisation of policy makers, educators, developers and researchers who 
      collaborate in publishing research studies, case studies and reports aimed 
      at improving the use of innovative digital technologies in classrooms and 
      in professional learning communities</p>
    <p>As discussed in the Joint Statement by NAACE, CAS and ITTE on ICT and Computer 
      Science in UK schools, 25 June 2012, we welcome the inclusion of more explicit 
      Computer Science in the proposed new curriculum and the development of a 
      new Programme of Study for ICT made up of the three strands of Digital Literacy 
      (DL), Computer Science (CS) and Information Technology (IT).</p>
    <p>However, we have deep concerns about the recent announcements regarding 
      the ending of teacher training courses in ICT for 2013/14. We have consulted 
      within the teacher training community and with school colleagues. A number 
      of key themes and questions are being raised that we felt we should draw 
      to your attention. We have suggested possible solutions to these issues.</p>
    <p>1. The draft document for the new ICT PoS suggests all pupils need to be 
      taught the three areas of CS, IT and Digital Literacy (DL). We agree with 
      this approach. However, there is an apparent inconsistency in then removing 
      all teacher training courses in ICT and only having teacher training courses 
      in Computer Science. Will CS courses be required to train new teachers in 
      all three strands? If not, how will the IT and DL strands be taught effectively 
      in schools? If new courses include all three strands, they will not be strictly 
      CS specialist courses; they will be in the light of the currently developing 
      Programme of Study, ICT courses.</p>
    <p>A solution would be to have 'Computing/ICT' courses covering all 3 strands, 
      to indicate the shift away from 'old' ICT. Alternatively, keep a number 
      of ICT courses, to be revised, as well as introducing specialist CS courses.</p>
    <p>2. Schools are very concerned because they will still need new teachers 
      to teach KS3 (which does not have to have any explicit CS under the recently 
      disapplied PoS) and KS4 ICT exam courses, before the new Curriculum and 
      examination specifications are introduced. Schools are asking us where these 
      new teachers are to come from if ICT teacher training courses are discontinued.</p>
    <p>Keeping some current ICT courses in place for 2013/14 and complimenting 
      these with some &#8216;Computing/ICT&#8217; courses, which are all then 
      revised and perhaps renamed to meet the new Programme of Study and associated 
      curriculum as it is published would address this issue.</p>
    <p>3. Discussions have mentioned a figure of 500 Computing Specialist new 
      teachers being trained. This is a significantly lower figure than the number 
      of ICT trainees currently on training courses. Given that one of the problems 
      highlighted repeatedly by Ofsted and others has been a lack of specialist 
      teachers in the subject area, this can only exacerbate the problems that 
      ICT has had, undermining the good work that has gone into the currently 
      developing ICT Programme of Study. Lack of suitably qualified, specialist 
      teachers is likely to result in poor delivery of the new Curriculum, which 
      is something everyone wants to avoid.</p>
    <p>Keeping some current ICT courses in place for 2013/14, which are then revised 
      to meet the new curriculum as ICT or &#8216;Computing&#8217; courses, alongside 
      specialised CS courses, would address this issue. However, fundamental to 
      solving this is raising the number of training places on qualifying courses, 
      perhaps named &#8216;Computing/ICT&#8217;, to 1000.</p>
    <p>4. The time frame to develop new teacher training courses is very challenging. 
      The selection of appropriate providers is critical and this must happen 
      very quickly if courses are to be ready for delivery in 2013/14. The two 
      areas of IT and CS are distinct and effective specialist teaching requires 
      different pedagogical approaches applied to particular domains of subject 
      knowledge. For some providers, this will involve much more than simply adapting 
      an existing ICT course. A number of current successful ITT courses, although 
      called 'ICT', already train teachers of CS. The policy of removing all ICT 
      ITT courses does not recognise the distinction between different courses.</p>
    <p>An audit of existing provision may help identify which providers can best 
      offer (new) ICT/Computing and which can best offer Computer Science courses.</p>
    <p>5. Recruitment to ITT has already started but providers don't know if and 
      what they can market for ICT/Computer Studies. Uncertainty may lead to the 
      loss of high quality potential applicants if they don't know that new courses 
      are going to exist or where to apply for them.</p>
    <p>Decisions on allocations need to be communicated to providers and potential 
      applicants as the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
    <p>6. Given the lack of schools currently teaching CS at KS4 and Post 16, 
      how can 11-18 (or even 11-16) CS training courses be justified in the current 
      inspection framework? The CAS network of CS teaching excellence will be 
      a useful body for providers to work with (through School Direct or PGCE), 
      but there are too few of these and they are not necessarily in the appropriate 
      geographical locations to meet recruitment requirements. Are Ofsted going 
      to be told to be 'lenient' in the inspection of the new CS training courses 
      until more schools teach CS at KS4 and Post 16?</p>
    <p>A two year period of time where there is support in place to ensure high 
      quality new teacher training courses (School Direct and PGCE), where significantly 
      more schools can develop KS4 and Post 16 CS courses and new ICT KS3 programmes 
      and where links between schools and providers can be facilitated, before 
      inspections begin of new courses, would seem a positive way to raise the 
      quality of teaching in the subject area.</p>
    <p>7. Historically, even with bursaries, the number of graduates with good 
      degrees in CS who applied to teaching was very small. There are many attractive 
      alternatives, given the shortage of CS graduates at present. This strategy 
      will make teaching more attractive to some, but, as has been recognised, 
      there is a need for Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) courses in CS. The 
      timescale to put these in place for 2013 is very tight. Selection of appropriate 
      SKE providers soon is crucial to get these SKE courses in place and to market 
      them. It may also be worth considering whether CS trainees should be awarded 
      the highest priority bursary rates along with other specialised science 
      colleagues.</p>
    <p>8. Not surprisingly, those involved in delivering current courses are concerned 
      about their futures. Clarity is needed on which providers will receive allocations 
      for teacher training, for how many places and in what areas. If providers 
      lose ICT courses and consider staff redundancies, there is a significant 
      risk of the permanent loss of expertise in the use of technology to support 
      teaching and learning, not only as a specialist area but also across all 
      subjects. This would be detrimental to education in general and to the standing 
      of England as a world leader in educational technology.</p>
    <p>Decisions on allocations need to be communicated to providers and potential 
      applicants as the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
    <p>We hope you will consider our concerns and suggestions and re-examine the 
      recent decision to immediately remove all ICT teacher training courses for 
      2013/14. We welcome the move to include more CS in the school curriculum, 
      but CS is only one of three important strands that our future leaders should 
      study. We need teachers who can teach all three strands effectively. We 
      do need specialist CS teachers for KS4 and post 16 courses, but we also 
      need specialist teachers who can teach IT at KS3 and KS4 and beyond.</p>
    <p>Your response to the concerns we have raised and a clear statement at the 
      earliest opportunity about what will happen next with allocations will be 
      very welcome.</p>
    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
